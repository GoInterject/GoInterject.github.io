### Updating to the Newest Version of Interject

**Step 1:** After you [log in](/wAbout/Logging-In.html), click the [**Check for Updates**](/wGetStarted/INTERJECT-Ribbon-Menu-Items.html#check-for-updates) button in the Interject ribbon. You cannot check for updates until you are logged in.

**Step 2:** A popup will appear with information about the computer's current, as well as the latest available Interject Version. If Interject has a critical update, there may also be an **Install By** date. If that is the case you must install the update as soon as possible. Click **Get Update** to get the new version. It should only take a moment.

**Note:** If this popup appears at any point without having clicked the **Check for Updates** button, it means that Interject has released an important update. Interject will not lock up into updating at any time, so its okay to postpone it momentarily, but its recommended that you update at the earliest convenience.

**Step 3:** After clicking **Get Update**, the Interject Excel Add-in Setup will pop up. Interject requires Excel to be closed to update. Click the exit button to close excel.

Once Excel has been closed click **Update** to continue to the update.

If you have any active or hidden Excel files open, the Add-in Manager will tell you which files are open and whether they've been saved. To avoid losing your work, please save the files and close Excel before continuing

**Step 4:** Two options will be available when installing on Windows Server.
