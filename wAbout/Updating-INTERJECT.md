###  Updating to the Newest Version of INTERJECT 

**Step 1:** In order to update INTERJECT, you will need to close Excel. So save anything open in Excel now.

**Step 3:** A popup will appear with information about the computer's current version as well as the latest available INTERJECT Version. If INTERJECT has a critical update, there may also be an **Install By** date. If that is the case you must install the update as soon as possible. **New Version Notes** is where you can see any notes about the new versions and what they may entail. Click **Get Update** to get the new version. It should only take a moment.

**Note:** If this popup appears at any point without having clicked the **Check for Updates** button, it means that INTERJECT has released an important update. INTERJECT will not lock up into updating at any time, so its okay to wait briefly. It is recommended, however, that you update at the earliest convenience. 

**Step 4:** After clicking **Get Update**, a popup will explain that Excel will need to reopen after the update is complete. Click **OK.**

Once that popup closes another popup will appear asking to download the update now, click **OK** to begin the update.
