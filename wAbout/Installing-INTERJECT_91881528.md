##  The INTERJECT Excel Add-in has Two Installation Paths 

There are 2 options when installing INTERJECT: 

  * **Installation Option 1:** Installing from the Portal Management Website using a ClickOnce installer for Windowsâ„¢. This option is intended for single users to log into our portal to install INTERJECT. This option is quick, easy, and requires the fewest steps. 
    * **Installation Option 2:** Installing via an Enterprise level MSI installer. This option is for large user bases that have standard configurations. This option is installed with a session controller who distributes the product to all necessary computers. While more technical, user set-up is still simple. 

###  Option 1: From Portal Management Website 

**Step 1:** Navigate to [ https://portal.gointerject.com ](https://portal.gointerject.com/login.html)

**Step 2:**

  1. With an existing account, log in to the portal website with the same credentials used for the INTERJECT Excel Add-in. 
  2. If you do not have an account, create one in the portal site by **Requesting an Invite** . INTERJECT will review your business information and provide a trial experience.

Any additional files will be downloaded by the installer.

INTERJECT will be **registered** within Excel as an Add-in. It will appear the next time Excel is started.

**Step 6 (For new installations):** If this is a new installation, then some preliminary settings are chosen. These can be changed later through the [ INTERJECT ribbon menu ](/wPortal/INTERJECT-Ribbon-Menu-Items_83689479.html) . Standard users will use the INTERJECT Cloud option. If a company has arranged for unique configurations, a Custom Install Code might be used. Enterprise clients using a central MSI installation might use a Network Folder.

###  Option 2: Enterprise level MSI installer 

This method is for installing INTERJECT using the MSI-based installer package. Since each MSI is tailored to an individual customer, this will be a general overview of the steps for this option. The MSI-based installation also depends on the Interject Session Controller. The Interject Session Controller needs to run with elevated permissions, and it is used to manage the INTERJECT Add-in on multi-user servers. 

**Step 1:** Acquire the zip folder with the INTERJECT install files and extract wherever you would like.

Inside will be three files. An executable, an MSI and, a text file. Before starting, take a look at the "readme.txt", which will have the most up-to-date information on the installation.

**Step 2:** With the INTERJECT MSI option, you have 2 possible methods to install: One uses the Command Line (.cmd). The other uses the Executable (.exe). For both options, you need to run the .cmd or .exe in administrator mode. 

**Method 1:** Command Line 

Open the text file and copy the line that will install INTERJECT. **Note:** Update the path to the MSI mid-way through the line.

It will look like this in Command Prompt. Press enter to finish the installation. Since you are installing in quiet mode, no other action is needed.

**Note:** Make sure to restart Excel after installing. 

**Method 2:** The other option is using the executable 

**Step 1:** Right click the executable and allow it to open as administrator.
