From simple PL charts for accountants to trend reports for CEO's and CFO's, there are a variety of processes you may encounter. In this section, you will look at three Real-World scenarios that explain how to use INTERJECT. Keep in mind, these are simple examples of tasks that may be more complicated in different cases. 

###  [ Customer Aging ](/wAbout/Customer-Aging_128091294.html)

This lab is a basic Customer Aging demo for tracking multiple customer invoices. For the walk-through, you will open a basic aging summary. You will then drill into the details tab, take notes on specific unpaid invoices, and save them back to the database. This Customer Aging report will also provide the data needed to drill further into each order and customer. 

###  [ Inventory Reports ](/wAbout/Inventory-Reports_128091499.html)

This lab is a basic example for tracking product quantities in and out of our inventory. For this walk-through, you will open a basic summary of our product categories and total quantities. You will then drill into the Inventory Detail tab to view the specific products within that category. There is also a secondary inventory option which allows us to view all of the categories and the products within them in a single sheet. 

###  [ Financial Reports ](/wAbout/Financial-Report_128091561.html)

This lab is for controllers or accountants who work with financial data and spreadsheets. In this walk-through, you will open a Profit and Loss (PL) Trend report and drill into the supporting detail from the general ledger detail. The Journal Entry (JE) Query report will provide our account level detail and will allow us to drill further into each journal entry.
