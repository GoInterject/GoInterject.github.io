##  **Overview**

The Report Library is a way for your team to share reports from a central
location going beyond just a Sharepoint or a Shared Network Folder.The reports
are uploaded to the library and can be accessed from any computer using Excel
via INTERJECT. The reports can also be versioned, so reverting to a previous
report is simple.

###  Getting to The Report Library

Once INTERJECT is installed, an INTERJECT Ribbon will be added to Excel.

**Step 1:** To begin, open the Report Library by opening the INTERJECT ribbon
menu.

###  Using The Report Library

Navigating the Report Library is crucial for efficient use. Each section of
the Report Library is detailed below.

Before opening a report from the library, look through the Folders and Report
Links, and check the Link Version of the desired report.

**Section 1:** Once the Library is opened, select the desired folder in the
**Folders** section.

**Section 2:** Select a report in the **Report Link** section. These are the
links that, when clicked, will open a particular report.

**Section 3:** Select which version you want to use. It is recommended you use
the most recent (green) version, as it is likely the best and most stable.
Link Version shows the details of a specific report and any of its available
versions. It is important to check Link Version before selecting **Open Link**
.  If the you are an administrator or report writer, all previously uploaded
versions are shown.  Each version is specified in the box at the bottom right
of the Report Library window, and they are color-coded to show the stage of
development (see image above).

  *     * _Green_ : Currently Live 
    * _Yellow_ : In Testing 
    * _Red_ : In Development 
    * _Gray_ : Superseded, this is an older version of a previous live report 

**Section 4:** If you are unsure what the report is for, clicking **View
Documentation** on the upper right-hand corner is particularly useful. It
should include the history of version changes and a manual explaining how to
use the report. If the link is grey, the documentation is not yet ready.

**

  

**Section 5:** Now click **Open Link** to open the report.

The selected link will open the following report.

**Note:** Reports are stored in Excel Reports, therefore the reports do not
need to be  saved locally. When report updates are finished, simply press **[
Save Data ](/wPortal/INTERJECT-Ribbon-Menu-Items_83689479.html) ** from the
INTERJECT ribbon menu, and the new changes will be saved back to the database.
