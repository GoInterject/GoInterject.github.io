##  **Overview:**

The Per-Computer installation installs INTERJECT for multiple users on one computer, such as a shared server. This also depends on the INTERJECT Addin Manager software. The INTERJECT Addin Manager is used to manage the INTERJECT Excel Add-in settings for multiple users. These settings are independent for each user. In order to run Per-Computer installation, you must have administrative-elevated rights.
