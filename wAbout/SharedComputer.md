##  **Overview:**

The Per-Computer installation installs INTERJECT for multiple users on one computer, such as a shared server. This also depends on the INTERJECT Addin Manager software. The INTERJECT Addin Manager is used to manage the INTERJECT Excel Add-in settings for multiple users. These settings are independent for each user. In order to run Per-Computer installation, you must have administrative-elevated rights.

--------------- Advanced Installation by the Command Line -------------- 
The installer can be run silently from the command line by targeting the InterjectSetup_Production_40_Standard_2.3.18.0.exe file. This will install as 'per-machine': 
-Run the Command Prompt as administrator.
-Update the path so it targets the .exe file.
      C:\[Path_To_Exe]\InterjectSetup_Production_40_Standard_2.3.18.0.exe /i // /qn ALLUSERS=1

key:
/i = install -or- /x = uninstall
/qn = quiet mode 
// = Used by Advanced Installers .exe file to automatically replace with <path_to_msi>. 
ALLUSERS = installs as 'per-machine' when set to 1. set to 0 to install as 'per-user' 

to uninstall use a similar command with /x: (point to the .exe file of the current installation)
      C:\[Path_To_Exe]\InterjectSetup_Production_40_Standard_2.3.18.0.exe /x // /qn ALLUSERS=1


--------------- Installation Logs -------------------------- 
Advanced Installer is the technology used to create the installer.
To see the install log (generated by the Advanced Installer InterjectSetup_Production_40_Standard_2.3.18.0.exe), run the install command with an additional parameter /L* from the command line:
(update the path to the exe and also where to save the install log)
      C:\[Path_To_Exe]\InterjectSetup_Production_40_Standard_2.3.18.0.exe /i // /qn /L* "C:\[Path_To_Exe]\install.log" 

Add-In-Express is the technology used to register the application as an Excel Addin
To see the Add-In-Express install log, go to this file: (update the path for the current user)
      C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Local\Interject\App\adxregistrator.log
      or here (for per-machine install):
      C:\Program Files (x86)\Interject\adxregistrator.log
```

</div>

**Step 12:** Select the desired install location by clicking **Browse...**. By default it will create a folder in the **Programs(x86)** folder.
