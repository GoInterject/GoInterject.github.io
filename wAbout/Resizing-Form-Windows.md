## Overview

When trying to read the text in the INTERJECT forms that pop up it can be difficult as the text may be too small. This is heavily dependent on your screen resolution size and other variables. Luckily there is a quick way to resize the text to help you make it easier to read and use INTERJECT's forms. This can be fixed in two different ways: resizing all of the windows individually, or resizing all the windows at once.

### Resizing Individual Windows

In this example you will resize the window that comes up when you click on the PULL Data button in the INTERJECT ribbon. The process is the same for all the INTERJECT windows that can be resized. 

**Step 1:** Open Excel to a blank workbook.

**Step 3:** Select the resize button and you will be presented with this menu:

<br>

> There are 3 predefined sizes for INTERJECT windows:
>
> * Small which is the default 100% view size
> * Medium which is 125% view size
> * Large which is 150% view size

**Step 4:** Select the **M** button to select the medium size.

Your window will now enlarge to look like the following:

There is also the ability to set a window to a custom view size within a range of 75% - 200%

**Step 5:** Enter 115 into the size field to reduce your window size to 115%

Your window will now shrink to be between the small size and the medium size and looks like the following image:

### Resizing All Windows

In addition to sizing individual windows, INTERJECT also allows you to use the current windows view size to set the size of all the other INTERJECT windows. If you have a specific window size that you like, then this will allow you to apply that to all your windows.

**Step 1:** Open Excel to a blank workbook.
