The CIO has specific needs when a company is growing. They are typically looking for the following:

 * Maximizing the utilization of existing software--extending the investment
 * Reducing labor costs for user support
 * Minimizing reporting staff
 * Providing department-point solutions without encumbering development staff
 * Limiting dependency on outside vendors
 * Reducing spreadsheet sprawl within the network
 * Mitigating the need for Access and Excel VBA projects
 * Report-activity-logging that provides insights to usage patterns and dependencies

Leveraging Interject's technology, CIOs will achieve all of these. And it is done by retaining control of customization. Interject need only be called when internal resources are too busy with other priorities.
