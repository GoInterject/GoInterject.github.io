Please note that these third parties may be in other countries where the laws on processing personal information may be less stringent than in your country.

### Our Security Measures to Protect your Personal Information

### Our Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, Web Analytics Services, and Links

- **Cookies**. Many of our web pages use “cookies.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. You have many choices with regards to the management of cookies on your computer. All major browsers allow you to block or delete cookies from your system. To learn more about your ability to manage cookies, please consult the privacy features in your browser.
- **Web Beacons**. Interject and third parties may also use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These “web beacons” may be used to deliver cookies that conform to Interject's cookie requirements.
- **Web Analytics Services**. We use Google Analytics, a service for the marketing analysis of the site provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to allow us to see how you use our site, so we can improve your experience. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use, available at [http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and the Google Privacy Policy, available at [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the site by disabling cookies in your browser. If you prefer to not have data reported by Google Analytics, you can install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, available at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
- **Website Links**. We may create links to other websites. We will make a reasonable effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual's right to privacy. However, many other sites that are not associated with or authorized by Interject may have links leading to our site. Interject cannot control these links and we are not responsible for any content appearing on these sites. Since this website does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy practices of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose any personal information to others.
- **App Links**. A given application may provide you with an advertising link to other, third-party sites and applications. Such third-party sites will have their own data collection practices and policies. Please review the privacy policy for such sites and exercise caution in providing information that personally identifies you. We have no responsibility, access, or control over the data collection practices and policies of such third-party sites and applications. You will use such sites and applications at your own risk and outside of the scope of this Privacy Policy. The provision of such advertisements is done on an “As Is” basis, with no endorsements or representations.
- **Other**. Interject websites may use third parties to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at its web pages and to conduct research about the advertisements and web usage. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you or the methods used by the third parties to collect that information.

### Limiting Use, Disclosure, Retention

Interject identifies the purposes for which the information is being collected before or at the time of collection. The collection of your personal data will be limited to that which is needed for the purposes identified by Interject. Unless you consent, or we are required by law, we will only use the personal data for the purposes for which it was collected. If Interject will be processing your personal data for another purpose later on, Interject will seek your further legal permission or consent; except where the other purpose is compatible with the original purpose. We will keep your personal data only as long as required to serve those purposes. We will also retain and use your personal data for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Accuracy of Personal data

We do our best to ensure that the personal data we hold and use is accurate. We rely on the customers we do business with to disclose to us all relevant information and to inform us of any changes.

### Your Access to and Updating of your Personal data

Reasonable access to your personal data may be provided upon request made to Interject at the contact information provided below. If access cannot be provided within that time frame, Interject will provide the requesting party a date when the information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, we will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied. We may charge a reasonable fee in advance for copying and sending the information requested. If you would like us to delete any personal Data held about you, we will do so on request unless we need to hold the information as part of the provision of products and services to you.

### Marketing Communications

We offer those who provide personal contact information a means to choose how we use the information provided. You may manage your receipt of marketing and non- transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of our marketing emails.

### Notice to End Users

Most of our services are intended for use by organizations. Where the services are made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the services and is responsible for the accounts and/or service over which it has control. Please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the services is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy. Administrators may be able to:

- help you exercise the rights described in Section 12 (if applicable)
- allow you to reset your account password
- restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to the services
- access information in and about your account
- access or retain information stored as part of your account
- change your information, including profile information associated with your account
- allow you or restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify, or delete information.

Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator's organizational policies for more information.

### Children's Privacy

Because of the nature of our business, our services are not designed to appeal to minors. We do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us immediately.

### Your California Privacy Rights (United States only)

Interject does not currently respond to browser “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals or other mechanisms. Third parties may collect personal data about your online activities over time and across sites when you visit the Site or use the Service. If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal data to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us by sending an e-mail to privacy@gointerject.com. Our sites, products, and services are not intended to appeal to minors. However, if you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of our Site or Service, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please send an email with a detailed description of the specific content or information to privacy@gointerject.com. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested. Under California law, California residents who have an established business relationship with us may opt-out of our disclosing personal data about them to third parties for their marketing purposes.

### Data Security

We shall take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Interject has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, Interject cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data on or transmitted via the Internet.

### Data Integrity and Purpose Limitations

We shall only process Personal Data in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, Interject shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use.

### Access

We acknowledge the individual's right to access their Personal Data. We shall allow an individual access to their Personal Data and allow the individual the opportunity to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Individuals may contact our Data Protection Officer via email at privacy@gointerject.com to request to access, correct, amend, or delete the personal information Interject holds about you. In cases where Interject is a Data Sub-Processor or Processor, individuals must contact the Data Processor or the Data Controller, as applicable.

### Changes to our Privacy Policy

Interject may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new version. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically as your continued use of this website and our products and services represents your agreement with the then-current Privacy Policy.

#### Contacting Us

We have designated a Data Protection Officer who is responsible for monitoring Interject's ongoing compliance of this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices or concerns of this site, please contact our Data Protection Officer at: privacy@gointerject.com.

#### Amendments

This Privacy Statement may be amended from time to time consistent with the requirements of the Shield Frameworks. We will post any revised policy on this website.

#### Information Subject to Other Policies

We are committed to following the Principles for all Personal Data within the scope of the Privacy Shield Frameworks. However, certain information is subject to policies of Interject that may differ in some respects from the general policies set forth in this Privacy Statement.
