## Overview

The Report Library is designed to be a central hub for all your report sharing and organizational needs. It contains its own folder hierarchy (3 levels deep for simplicity) for basic organization. You can sort reports within a folder and also the nested folders themselves. Standard operations such as editing, moving, and deleting are available as well.

### Sorting Reports Links

Report links in a Report Library folder appear in the **Report Links** section:

<br>

The order is determined by the report's **Sort** property:

<br>

The **Sort** property is a numerical value that will sort the report in relation to the other report's **Sort** property. In other words, the reports will be sorted based on their **Sort** value (ascending). If two reports have identical values, they will be sorted in order of their Link ID:

<br>

You can view and edit the report's **Sort** value and its details by right clicking on the report, click **Selected Link**, and then **Edit**

From the Link Details window, you can change the sort value and then click **Save**:

### Sorting Folders

Sorting folders is done in a similar manner. Simply right click on the folder, click **Edit Folder** and then adjust the **Folder Sort** value and press Enter:

### Folder Organization

Adding a folder is easy. Right click on the folder you want to add a subfolder, click **Add Subfolder**. Enter a name for the folder and press Enter.

From the folder menu, you can also **Edit** a folder or **Delete** a folder.
