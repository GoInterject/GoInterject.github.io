## Overview

Occasionally, new users will need to be added to Interject. This overview is a step by step process on how to add a new user to Interject using the Portal site. Adding a new user can be accomplished only by the ClientAdmin [role](/wPortal/INTERJECT-Roles.html#overview).

### Adding a New User

**Step 1:** Navigate to [https://portal.gointerject.com](https://portal.gointerject.com/login.html).

**Step 2:** Log in to Interject with your credentials.

**Step 6:** The only other entry required is the User Name. If it is left blank, it will default to the email address. It is typical to have the user name the same as the email address. The other address fields are optional. Minimize the section by clicking **SHOW LESS** and move on to the password.

**Step 7:** The password must have a minimum of 6 characters. After adding it, click on the **Create** Button to create the new user profile.

The basic profile is complete! The user is assigned the Standard role by default. If any other role needs to be assigned, continue reading the next section.

### Adding an Interject Role

All new users by default are assigned to the Standard role, which means they can run reports in the Report Library. However, there are other roles such as managing updates to the Report Library, Custom Commands, and being a ClientAdmin. For a list of the Interject Roles, see [here](/wPortal/INTERJECT-Roles.html#overview).

For this scenario, David will be assigned to the ClientAdmin role.

**Step 1:** Follow the above steps to log in to the Portal site and find the user in the Staff page that needs a new role.

**Step 2:** Select the appropriate role from the Available Role list.
