## Overview

This section is for users working with reports and applications created by others. You will run through the basic navigation and control methods most helpful for working efficiently. Please note that every report may be different and may have it's own documentation in the Report Library. See the [Report Library Basics](/wAbout/Report-Library-Basics.html) page for further details.

### [Installing Interject](/wAbout/SingleUser.html)

Installing Interject is a simple process. There are two install types for Interject, the first is a [single user](/wAbout/SingleUser.html) install, and the other is for installing on a [shared computer](/wAbout/SharedComputer.html). If you are not sure which one to use, then you should install the single user version.

### [Logging In](/wAbout/Logging-In.html)

Logging in is simple and fast! Once logged in we can begin exploring the Report Library detailed in the following pages.

### [Report Library Basics](/wAbout/Report-Library-Basics.html)

The Report Library is a way to share reports with other users on your team. Reports are uploaded to the library and can be accessed from any computer using the Interject app in Excel. The features in Interject go beyond a Sharepoint or Shared Network Folder. Files can also be versioned, so reverting to a working report is simple.

### [Report Library Links] (/wAbout/ReportLibraryLinks.html)

The Report Library provides an easy interface where new reports can be uploaded, existing reports can be updated, and details and documentation about the report can be added. Reports are called links in the Library. These links can be a link to a file you have saved locally or one uploaded to the Report Library.

### [Real-World Walkthroughs](/wAbout/Real-World-Walkthroughs.html)

From simple PL charts for accountants to trend reports for CEO's and CFO's, there are a variety of processes we may encounter. In these labs, you will look at three Real-World scenarios that explain how to use Interject. Keep in mind, these are simple examples of tasks that may be more complicated in other situations.
