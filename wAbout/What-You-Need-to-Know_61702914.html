   Finding integrated reporting solutions to fit your needs is difficult enough, let alone finding one that can scale with your company's growth. INTERJECT was built for large companies with hundreds of users that run thousands of reports each day.
   <span>
    INTERJECT commonly handles report volumes over
   </span>
   of 300,000 per month, and
   <span>
    we
   </span>
   can manage much, much more.

   also fits within the specific needs of smaller organizations and is a particular benefit since it can scale with the company as it grows. In business today, data is exploding all around us, and the reporting needs of an organization never slow down.

   INTERJECT helps seal the cracks in existing software and provides bridges connecting disparate systems. We help everything work together so existing software investments can scale even further, and so costly software replacements are delayed.

  <p>
   Purchasing key software can leave you dependent on vendors for costly customizations. This prohibits it's practical use over time. INTERJECT hands the control of any and all reporting solutions to your IT department or business analysts. Since INTERJECT leverages common database and cloud API technologies, it lets organizations grow their systems internally.

    The heart of INTERJECT's functionality is that reports and applications are stored in a central server where they cannot be changed by spreadsheet users. The spreadsheet is simply the front-end. Should any modifications cause an error in reporting, users can revert to the prior spreadsheet file.

   Save files, make new copies, open them again, and we can still update the report. Just open them in a computer with INTERJECT. Most types of reports (

    Data Lists
   </a>
   ) are easily shareable to non-INTERJECT users via spreadsheet files. When a returned file is opened in INTERJECT, all data features are retained.

  </h4>
  <p>
   When spreadsheet report templates are saved in the INTERJECT Report Library, they are available to others in an INTERJECT client profile. Users can open the file and use it. If a new version is uploaded to the Report Library, any user that selects that report will have the latest version. A file can always be saved in a personal folder to experiment with possible spreadsheet changes, without altering data. To help with new report development, the Report Library can handle the "Dev," "Test," and "Live" stages of a report life-cycle. Click

   report formulas. These special formulas use the rows on top of a spreadsheet to specify which columns are listed in the report and how they are presented. Columns can be moved or deleted, and new DataPortal supported columns can be added. Data Lists reports are designed for users to customize.
