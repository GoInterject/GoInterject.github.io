   From simple PL charts for accountants to trend reports for CEO's and CFO's, there are a variety of processes you may encounter. In this section, you will look at three Real-World scenarios that explain how to use INTERJECT. Keep in mind, these are simple examples of tasks that may be more complicated in different cases.

   This lab is a basic Customer Aging demo for tracking multiple customer invoices. For the walk-through, you will open a basic aging summary. You will then drill into the details tab, take notes on specific unpaid invoices, and save them back to the database.

   This lab is a basic example for tracking product quantities in and out of our inventory. For this walk-through, you will open a basic summary of our product categories and total quantities. You will then drill into the Inventory Detail tab to view the specific products within that category. There is also a secondary inventory option which allows us to view all of the categories and the products within them in a single sheet.
