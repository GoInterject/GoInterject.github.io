**Step 6:** The only other entry required is the User Name. If it is left blank, it will default to the email address. It is typical to have the user name the same as the email address. The other address fields are optional. Minimize the section and move on to the password.

The basic profile is complete! The user by default is assigned the Standard role. If any other role needs to be assigned, continue reading the next section.

###  **Adding an Interject Role:**

All new users by default are assigned to the Standard role, which means they can run reports in the Report Library. However, there are other roles such as managing updates to the Report Library, Custom Commands, and being a Client Admin. 

For this scenario, David will be assigned to the Client Admin role. 

**Step 1:** Follow the above steps to log in to the Portal site and find the user in the Staff page that needs a new role. 

**Step 2:** Select the appropriate role from the Available Role list.
