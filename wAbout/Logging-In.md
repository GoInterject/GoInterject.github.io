##  Before Using INTERJECT, Here's How to Login 

Logging in is simple and fast! After logging in once, you can set up auto-login, which saves you from entering credentials each time. You can also log into multiple accounts. 

###  Locating the Login Form 

**Step 1:** Select the Login button on the INTERJECT Ribbon.  ![](/images/LogginIn/interject-ribbon-advanced-menu-login-revised.png)

**Step 2:** Select the company you will be logging with. In this case it will be Interject. 

**Note:** You can skip this form in the future by checking the box in the bottom left.

###  Process to Log In 

Whichever option is chosen, the login process that follows is the same. 

**Step 1:** Select the type of account to log in with. In this example, the **INTERJECT** account type is used. 

**Step 2:** Type in your user name and password.

**Step 3:** Check the box marked **Auto Login next time** to skip this step in the future. 

**Note:** We highly suggest using **Auto Login**, otherwise credentials are required whenever accessing the [ ReportLibrary ](/wAbout/Report-Library-Basics.html). 

Now you're logged in!
