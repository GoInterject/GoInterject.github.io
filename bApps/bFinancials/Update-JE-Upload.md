### Updating

Whenever an update of Interject for Journal Entry Upload is released, an update script must be run on your server. With each new update, the initial install script located on the [Technical Install](https://docs.gointerject.com/bApps/bFinancials/JE-Upload-Install.html) page will be updated. If you initally installed the most current version listed above, you will not need to run the Update Script.

> To Upgrade
> 
> In SQL Management Studio, run the script labeled **Update for Previous Install** at the top of this page.

> Run \[Interject_SetupScript1_Security\], as shown below, to re-enable security.
>
>  ```SQL
> EXEC [Setup].[Interject_SetupScript1_Security]
>	@MasterEpicorDatabase = '<Epicor Controlling Database Name>'
>	,@CertificatePassword =  'myPassword1234'
>  ```
>

### Rolling Back One Version

The following steps must be taken to roll back one version. Note that this will only roll to the previous version.

> To Roll Back
