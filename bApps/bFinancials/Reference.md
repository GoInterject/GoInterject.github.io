## Reference

This deployment documents the steps and procedures to deploy Interjectâ€™s Financials for Spreadsheets as a replacement for FRx Financial Reports for Epicor Enterprise 7.x.

FRx, a Microsoft product, has reached its end-of-life, and official support is ending. Even though this initial deployment focuses on the replacement of FRx and financial reporting, Interject will also be utilized across other departments, functions, and data sources to bring SQL based reporting into the familiar Excel user interface.

This deployment guide assumes the migration of the FRx Sysdata has already taken place in a development environment. Databases and tools used during the FRx Sysdata migration are not needed on BETA and PROD servers and therefore excluded from this guide.
