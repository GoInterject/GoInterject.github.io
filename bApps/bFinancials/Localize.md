A subscription to Interject Financial - Epicor will provide a "Subscriptions" folder in the **Report Library** within the “Interject Financial Epicor” folder. The folder contains the latest versions of your provided transactional reports. A company or implementer may also choose to customize the parameters of these reports to better reflect company naming conventions. Following are the localization steps required to tailor transactional reports.

>
> **Step 1:** Open the Interject Report Library and find the report that will be localized. Right-click the Report Link and View Details of the report.
>
> 
>
> **Step 2:** Make a note of the current Data Drills for Link. The links will need to be setup the same way in a later step.
>
>  
>
> **Step 3:** Exit the View Detail window and open the Report Link from the Interject Report Library.
>
>
>
> **Step 4:**  Review the report and determine if there are filter name labels. If there are then match the segment configurations by typing over the current filter name. If a filter is not used, it can be deleted. The segment configuration can be found by opening the Interject Financials Configuration Manager report and clicking on step 2 to Review Segments.

>  **Step 5:** Once the filters have been re-named, make sure to clear any data from the Excel sheet and save the Excel file to your local computer.

Select the company folder, right click, and select “Add Subfolder”. Name the subfolder accordingly. For example, “Trial Balance Reports” and press Enter to Save New Folder.
