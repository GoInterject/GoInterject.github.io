### Updating

Whenever an update of Interject for Financials is released, an update script must be run on your server. With each new update, the initial install script located on the [Technical Install](https://docs.gointerject.com/bApps/bFinancials/Technical-Install.html) page will be updated. If you initally installed the most current version listed above, you will not need to run the Update Script. If you orginally installed a version older than the most current, take the following steps to update your implementation. 

> To Upgrade
> 
> In SQL Management Studio, run the script labeled **Update for Previous Install** at the top of this page.
>
> Run \[Interject_SetupScript1_Security\], as shown below, to re-enable security.
>
>  ```SQL
> EXEC [Custom].[Interject_SetupScript1_Security]
>	@MasterEpicorDatabase = '<Epicor Controlling Database Name>'
>	,@CertificatePassword =  'myPassword1234'
>  ```
>

### Rolling Back One Version

The following steps must be taken to roll back one version. Note that this will only roll to the previous version.

> To Roll Back
>
> In SQL Management Studio, run the script labeled **Rollback to ** previous install at the top of this page.
>
> Run \[Interject_SetupScript1_Security\], as shown below, to re-enable security.
>
>  ```SQL
> EXEC [Custom].[Interject_SetupScript1_Security]
