Before installing Interject Financials - Epicor Enterprise, you will need to request an invite at the [Interject Portal Site](https://portal.gointerject.com). Fill out every field of the invite request form, and click "Create an Account". The Interject team will review and grant access to the Interject Platform.

After gaining access as a new company, there are three parts to installing Interject Financials - Epicor Enterprise. First is the initial data tier install, then the data load from Epicor and FRx, then the actual report configurations in the Interject application. 

\(Before installing Interject for Financials, check that your system meets all requirements noted in the [Product Sheet](https://docs.gointerject.com/bApps/bFinancials/Epicor-Financials.html).
