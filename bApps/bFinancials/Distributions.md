After building your report templates, you can run automated distributions of those templates directly from the reports you build. This allows you to create the same report templates for each segment or company you import and select. Following are the steps to do distributions on your templates.

> To Do
>
> **Step 1:** Create a report template following [these steps](https://docs.gointerject.com/bApps/bFinancials/ReportTemplates.html), and choose "Yes" in the Distributions field before creating the report. A "Distribution" tab will be available with the report based on the segment rollups imported and built into the report.

> **Step 3:** You may add segments as needed, or you may remove them. **Note:** be sure to fill in the Rollup Segment that correspond with the rollup used to create the report template. Click the "Run Distribution" button, and hit "Run Distribution" in the pop-up window.
