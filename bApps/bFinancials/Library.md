### Using the Report Library
Use the Report Library to access and share reports. Any computer on your network can access shared reports through Interject, provided users are authorized. Reports can also be versioned, so reverting to a previous report is simple.


> To-do
>
> **Step 1:** Use Ctrl-Shift-L or click the Report Library button on the Interject ribbon.
> Note: If not logged in already, you will be prompted to do so.
>
> **Step 2:** Select your desired folder on the left. 
>
>  **Step 3:** Pick a report link on the right.
>
> **Step 4:** Always check the **Link Version** before opening a report. **The most recent version is green**, and that’s the version you should typically open. Each report is described briefly in the Link Version window and its available versions are listed. 
>
> **Step 5:** Click Open Link to open the report.
