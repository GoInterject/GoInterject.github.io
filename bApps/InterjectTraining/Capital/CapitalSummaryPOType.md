The Capital amounts pulled in on this tab are summed by their account groupings in a quarterly view on the left, and by month on the right. At the bottom of the tab is another detailed view of the PO Items.

## Hidden Replacement Section

Hidden on the right side of the report (grouped in column AM) are the columns with the Replacement information. If the PO Item is a Replacement, the Replacement info will be here.
