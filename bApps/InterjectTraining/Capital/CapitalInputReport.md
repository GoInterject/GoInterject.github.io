## What is new?

**Closure Tabs**:
The closure tabs are only used for sites with landfill closure. You will be notified by Corporate Accounting if you need to complete the closure tool.

**Update POs with new numbers**:
If you update an existing PO with a new number, it will renumber the existing PO instead of creating a new one.
