## Overview

The Capital Module is designed to handle Capital POs, and provides tools for controllers to review Capital allocations across sites and available assets.

### Capital Input Tool

Use this tool to save new and update existing Capital POs. The other tabs in this tool are used to provide sumary views on the Capital POs for better analysis and control.

### Capital Change History Tool

This tool provides an in-depth view into the historical data for the Capital PO changes.

### Capital Export Tool

The Capital Export Tool exports the Capital POs from the Capital module into the DMS module. Once in DMS, you can edit the Capital POs with Toolbox.
