## Overview

The Capital Module is designed to handle Capital POs, and provides tools for controllers to review Capital allocations across sites and available assets. The [ Capital Input Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Capital/CapitalInputReport.html) is the most prevalent report in this set, and is used to save new and update existing Capital POs. Other tools available here are the [ Capital Change History Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Capital/CCQuery.html) which gives a historical view to all of the Capital Changes made, and the [ Capital Export Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Capital/CapitalExport.html) which exports the POs from Capital into DMS, where they can be further managed.
