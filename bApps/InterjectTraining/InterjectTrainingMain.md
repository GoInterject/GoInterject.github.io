##  **Overview**

There are many modules that Interject offers to help with managing money and other company resources. In this section, you will look through three core modules and the tools they offer to give better visibility and control over the resources under your jurisdiction.

###  [ Capital Module ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Capital/CapitalModule.html)

The Capital Module is designed to handle Capital POs, and provides tools for controllers to review Capital allocations across sites and available assets. The [ Capital Input Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Capital/CapitalInputReport.html) is the most prevalent report in this set, and is used to save new and update existing Capital POs. Other tools available here are the [ Capital Change History Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Capital/CCQuery.html) which gives a historical view to all of the Capital Changes made, and the [ Capital Export Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Capital/CapitalExport.html) which exports the POs from Capital into DMS, where they can be further managed.

###  [ Budget Module ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetModule.html)

This module is focused on giving controllers the tools and structure to save Budgets in a clean and efficient manner. The [ Local Budget Template ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetTemplate.html) is a report that sites can download and manage independantly, giving a lot of freedom and control to how money is budgeted to their accounts. Other notable tools in this module include the [ Budget Upload Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetUpload.html) where controllers can dump budgeted accounts altogether in one fell swoop, the [ Budget Change Query Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetChangeQuery.html) which provides different views to how Budgets have changed over the budget season, and the [ Control Center ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/ControlCenter.html) which controls who has access to save to Budgets and when the data will flow from the Budget Module into Interject.

###  [ Projections Module ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionModule.html)

The Projections Module gives controllers the tools needed to forecast the amounts they think they will need in the upcoming months. To save their initial projection forecasts, the [ Local Projections Template ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionTemplate.html) is used, and it closely matches the [ Local Budget Template ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetTemplate.html) in design and function. Other Projections tools include the [ Projections Change Query Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionChangeQuery.html) which gives insight into how Projections have changed while open, and the [ Projections Upload Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionUpload.html) which is identical to the [ Budget Upload Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetUpload.html) but used for Projections.
