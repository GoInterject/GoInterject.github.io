## Overview

The Projections Module gives controllers tools needed to forecast the amounts they project as necessary in the upcoming months.

### [ Projection Template ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionTemplate.html)

The Local Projections Template is used to save to a district's Projections for a given month. This template closely matches the Local Budget Template in design and function.

### [ Projection Upload Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionUpload.html)

The Projections Upload Tool allows controllers to upload projections for multiple accounts in a district at the same time. This upload tool closely matches the Budget Upload Tool in design and function.

### [ Projections Change Query ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionChangeQuery.html)

The Projections Change Query Tool provides insight to how Projections have been changed while open, with views on the summary and detail levels.
