## Overview

The Projections Module gives controllers the tools needed to forecast the amounts they think they will need in the upcoming months. To save their initial projection forecasts, the [ Local Projections Template ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionTemplate.html) is used, and it closely matches the [ Local Budget Template ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetTemplate.html) in design and function. Other Projections tools include the [ Projections Change Query Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionChangeQuery.html) which gives insight into how Projections have changed while open, and the [ Projections Upload Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionUpload.html) which is identical to the [ Budget Upload Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetUpload.html) but used for Projections.
