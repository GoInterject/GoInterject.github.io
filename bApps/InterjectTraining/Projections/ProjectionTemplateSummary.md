### [Projections Template](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionTemplate.html)

The Local Projections Template is used to save to a district's Projections for a given month. This template closely matches the Local Budget Template in design and function.

### [Projections Upload Tool](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Projections/ProjectionUpload.html)

The Projections Upload Tool allows controllers to upload projections for multiple accounts in a district at the same time. This upload tool closely matches the Budget Upload Tool in design and function.
