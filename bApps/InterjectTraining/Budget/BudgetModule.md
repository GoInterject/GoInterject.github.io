## Overview

This module is focused on giving controllers the tools and structure to save Budgets in a clean, efficient manner. The [Local Budget Template](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetTemplate.html) is a report that sites can download and manage independantly, providing more control over how money is budgeted to accounts. Other notable tools in this module include the [Budget Upload Tool](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetUpload.html), where controllers can dump budgeted accounts all together; the [Budget Change Query Tool](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetChangeQuery.html), which provides different views to how Budgets have changed over the budget season; and the [Control Center](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/ControlCenter.html), which controls who has access to save to Budgets and when the data will flow from the Budget Module into Interject.
