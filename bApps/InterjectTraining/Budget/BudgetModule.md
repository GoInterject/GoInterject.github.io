## Overview

This module is focused on giving controllers the tools and structure to save Budgets in a clean and efficient manner. The [ Local Budget Template ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetTemplate.html) is a report that sites can download and manage independantly, giving a lot of freedom and control to how money is budgeted to their accounts. Other notable tools in this module include the [ Budget Upload Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetUpload.html) where controllers can dump budgeted accounts altogether in one fell swoop, the [ Budget Change Query Tool ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetChangeQuery.html) which provides different views to how Budgets have changed over the budget season, and the [ Control Center ](/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/ControlCenter.html) which controls who has access to save to Budgets and when the data will flow from the Budget Module into Interject.
