## Overview

When encountering issues with the Interject Excel Add-in, it is helpful to gather as much information as possible before reaching out to tech support. This guide outlines the key areas to check and log, which can assist in diagnosing and potentially resolving issues on your own.

### Interject

- **_Current Version:_** Is the issue happening on a specific version of Interject? Did it start after an update? Log the version of Interject you are using.

- **_Interject Formulas:_** Does the issue happen with one particular Interject formula? Or is it multiple formulas?

### Spread of Issue

- **_User Impact:_** Identify how many users are experiencing the issue. Is it isolated to a single user or affecting multiple users?

### Frequency of Issue

- **_Occurrence:_** Note how often the issue occurs. Is it a one-time issue, intermittent, or consistent?

### System Environment

- **_Operating System:_** Record the operating system and version being used.

- **_Excel Version:_** Note the version of Excel being used, as compatibility issues can sometimes arise.

### Recent Changes

- **_Updates or Changes:_** Document any recent updates to Excel, Interject, or the operating system. Also, note any recent changes to network or security settings.

### Replication Steps

- **_Step-by-Step:_** Provide a detailed step-by-step description of how to replicate the issue. This includes the exact sequence of actions leading up to the problem.

### Authentication and Permissions

- **_User Role:_** Determine if the user experiencing the issue is a ClientAdmin or a Standard user. Different permissions can affect functionality.

- **_Federated Login:_** What identity system is being used?

### Firewall/Networking

- **_Check Proxy Network Setup:_** Ensure that there is no proxy network that could be blocking Interject.

- **_Firewall Settings:_** Verify that your firewall settings are not blocking Interjectâ€™s access to the internet.

- **_TLS:_** Are there special TLS requirements for the system?

### Antivirus Conflicts

- **_Antivirus Software:_** Check if your antivirus software is interfering with Interject. Temporarily disable the antivirus to see if the issue persists.

### Error Messages

- **_Error Logs:_** Document any error messages received. This includes pop-up errors within Excel or system logs.

- **_Addin Manger:_** Does the Addin Manager reveal any errors in the logs?

### Third-Party Add-ins

- **_Conflicts with Other Add-ins:_** Check if there are other Excel add-ins installed that might conflict with Interject. Temporarily disable other add-ins to see if the issue is resolved.

### Temporary Files and Cache
