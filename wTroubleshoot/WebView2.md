## Overview

Interject uses [WebView2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} for its login screen. If WebView2 is not installed, nothing will appear when you click the login button. Most systems have WebView2 already installed. If, however, it is not, you can install WebView2 manually.

### Verifying Installation

You can verify that WebView2 is installed by opening up the windows settings and viewing the installed programs.

#### Via Windows Settings

Press the âŠž Win + I to bring up the Windows settings. Alternatively you can click the Start button and type "Settings".
