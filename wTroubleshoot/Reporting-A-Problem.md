### Sending Logs

Some problems may occasionally require more extensive logging to identify and solve. Turning on [Verbose Logging](/wTroubleshoot/Verbose-Logging.html) will send more details when reporting a problem. You may also send [Memory Logs](/wTroubleshoot/RAM-Monitoring.html) by turning this feature on.

### Send Report to Interject

As long as verbose logging is turned on, Report a Problem can send user data and execution diagnostics to the Interject support team. To use Report a Problem:

**Step 1:** Click **User Support Help** from the Interject Ribbon.
