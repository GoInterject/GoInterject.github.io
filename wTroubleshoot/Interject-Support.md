## Overview

Interject Support in built into Excel via the Interject Add-in. You can easily report a problem to Interject or find Interject contact information. You also have the option of turning on certain logs in order to send more key details to Interject.

### [User Support](/wTroubleshoot/Reporting-A-Problem.html)

Interject User Support provides an easy interface within Excel to send a report or contact Interject.

### [Verbose Logging](/wTroubleshoot/Verbose-Logging.html)

To help diagnose any errors, Interject uses a Verbose Logging feature. The ideal goal of Verbose Logging is to help recreate an error and send logs to Interject's support team, where it can be fixed.

### [Memory Logging](/wTroubleshoot/RAM-Monitoring.html)

Memory Logging is a toggled tool in an Excel report. When it is turned on, the memory use of the current workbook is recorded. When coupling this with **Report a Problem**, the RAM memory log is sent, along with the report, to Interject support.
