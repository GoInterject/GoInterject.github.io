## Overview

The "List Data Portals" command in our Excel add-in diagnostics form outputs a comprehensive list of all data portals associated with the company in RTF (Rich Text Format). This feature provides a formatted document that details the data portals, making it easier to review and share the information. The RTF format ensures that the document maintains its structure and readability across different word processing applications. Users can convert this text output to an RTF file for a clearer and more professional display, which is particularly useful for documentation and reporting purposes.

When you **Execute Selected Action**, the result field will display the rtf text:

<br>

You can then extract this text and format to a RTF file with a document converter for a cleaned up display:
