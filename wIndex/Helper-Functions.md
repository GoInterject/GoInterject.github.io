## **Helper Functions Overview**

Helper Functions are functions that help streamline the report generation process and offer additional customization. They are often embedded into other parent functions to be leveraged into more specific and accurate functions or enhance their capabilities. Some can also be used as stand-alone functions to add functionality to the page.

Other Helper Functions are focused on the report itself and does not impact or direct data in the report. These functions can improve the speed and presentation of which data can be understood, manipulated and viewed in the report.
