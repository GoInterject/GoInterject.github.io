## Overview

The "Force Garbage Collection on Dead Memory" command in our Diagnostics form is a  tool designed to optimize memory usage by explicitly invoking the garbage collection process. This command instructs the .NET runtime to perform an immediate garbage collection cycle, which reclaims memory that is no longer in use by the application. By clearing out dead memory, it helps to reduce the application's memory footprint, prevent memory leaks, and enhance overall performance and stability. Use this command if you notice increasing memory usage or performance degradation, ensuring that your system resources are efficiently managed.
