## Function Summary

The ReportGrouping() INTERJECT formatting function is a triggered INTERJECT function. This means that upon the execution of an INTERJECT action, a triggered function is activated. There are several trigger combinations that can be utilized by ReportGrouping() that are listed [here](/wIndex/ReportGrouping.html#trigger-combination-list). A ReportGrouping() function is often used to collapse or expand a native excel grouping upon the execution of an INTERJECT action.

### Example Function Composition

|Argument Name|Example Mapping|Explanation|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Function Name|`=ReportGrouping()`|This is the excel function name used to call the function. It can only be used as a standalone function in a report.|
|OnPullSaveOrBoth|"Both"| This function will be executed on a Pull or a Save action. |
|OnClearRunOrBoth|"Run"| This function will be executed on a Pull-Run or a Save-Run Action+Event combination.|
|RowOrColumnGroup|"Column"|Specifies that that the groupings to be impacted will be "Column" groupings and thus "Row" groupings are left unaltered.|
|GroupLevel|"Collapse"|In combination with the RowOrColumnGroup argument, this will Collapse all column groupings on a Pull-Run, or Save-Run action.|
|Disabled|FALSE| This is left false since the ReportGrouping() function is active.|

### Trigger Combination List

The execution of the ReportGrouping() formatting function is determined by a combination of an INTERJECT action and an INTERJECT event. An action is a pull or save whereas an event is a clear or a run.
