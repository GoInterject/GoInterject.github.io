## **Formatting Functions Overview**

Formatting Functions are focused on the report itself and does not impact or direct data in the report. These functions can improve the speed and presentation of which data can be understood, manipulated and seen in the report. Once formatting functions are fully understood, reports can be dissected, analysed, and assessed at a much more rapid pace with a very low amount of impact on report run times.
