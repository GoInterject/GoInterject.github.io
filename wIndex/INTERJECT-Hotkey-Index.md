##  **Overview**

Interject provides ways to increase productivity and work flow by utilizing hotkeys to quickly perform Interject actions. These hotkeys are adaptable and customize-able and are a staple to being efficient when using Interject functions. Any hotkey listed here can be changed and set to different keystrokes. However, there is a limitation on available keystrokes to change the hotkeys to.

**Note:** The keystrokes and commands here are in a list format, they are not necessarily linked to each other by default unless they are aligned side by side. This is to be used to choose which command you want and choose which keystroke you want. The keystrokes in the keystrokes available section includes those that are already tied to default commands. Some of the keystrokes are not assigned to anything, and some of the commands are not assigned to anything.

**Step 3:** If it is not already there, paste this code into the `<appSettings></appSettings>` xml container. 

**Expand source** 
    
    
    <add key="shortkeychanges" value="True" />

![](/images/Hotkeys/10.jpg)
