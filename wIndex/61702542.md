##  Function Summary 

The jCombine() function is helpful for developers who want to concatenate the values of cells while simultaneously skipping any empty cell. jCombine() can use both a cell range and a list of cell addresses. A list of cell address will require a delimiting character between each of the cell address in the list. The delimiter character can be custom, but it is a comma by default. When using jCombine() in a delimited list, it needs to have a second pair of parentheses around the first set.
