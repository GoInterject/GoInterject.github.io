## **Event Functions Overview**

Event Functions are functions designed to run when a designated event triggers them. An Interject event is a Clear Data or Run event. A Run event can be a [Pull Data](/wGetStarted/INTERJECT-Ribbon-Menu-Items.html#pull-data) action or a [Save](/wGetStarted/INTERJECT-Ribbon-Menu-Items.html#save-data) action. The values defined within the event trigger function will determine when it is executed. These functions allow synchronization and data precision within the report.
