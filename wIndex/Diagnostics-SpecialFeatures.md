## Webview2/Browser Login

Interject provides an alternative to the standard Webview2 login form. Your default web browser can be used instead by setting the UseWebView2 switch in Diagnostics.

<blockquote class=highlight_note>
<b>Note:</b> Web browser login is explicitly supported for Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Brave, Vivaldi, and Internet Explorer, but may also work on other browsers.
