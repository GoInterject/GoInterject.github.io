##  **Creating in INTERJECT**

This section is for developers who need to create or modify reports. You will run through basic modification, creation, and publishing of reports. Feel free to [ contact ](mailto:help@gointerject.com) us if you cannot find your answer in these sections. 

  


###  [ Modifying an Existing Report ](/wGetStarted/Modifying-an-Existing-Report_62849215.html)

Reporting needs change often. Account details, specific formatting, even spreadsheet formulas require modification, that is why INTERJECT's reports are so highly customizable using familiar spreadsheet knowledge. This section walks through common report modifications using [ Customer Aging ](wGetStarted\L-Modify-CustomerAging_128428927.html) , [ Inventory ](wGetStarted\L-Modify-InventoryReport_128429185.html) , and [ Financial ](wGetStarted\L-Modify-FinancialReport_128429053.html) reports as an example. 

  


###  [ Creating a Simple Report ](/wGetStarted/Creating-a-Simple-Report_128408585.html)

This section details how to create reports from scratch. Here, you will walk through making a [ Customer Aging ](wGetStarted\L-Create-CustomerAging_128429314.html) and [ Customer Orders ](wGetStarted\L-Create-CustomerOrders_128421638.html) report from the ground up. The focus is on using simple single range tabular reports.

###  [ Drilling Between Reports ](/wGetStarted/Drilling-Between-Reports_61702193.html)

Creating drills, it is possible to generate a simple suite of reports that enable you and your end-users to navigate anywhere from within the spreadsheet environment. Examples in this section include building drills in a [ Customer Aging ](wGetStarted\L-Drill-CustomerAging_128421015.html) , [ Inventory ](wGetStarted\L-Drill-InventoryReport_128409138.html) , and [ Financial report ](wGetStarted\L-Drill-FinancialReport_128409219.html) . There is more than one way for the user to interact with the drill feature. See the page [ Three Ways to Drill ](/wGetStarted/L4.4-The-Three-Ways-to-Drill_128510906.html) for more details. 

###  [ Lab 5 Hiding Rows & Columns ](wGetStarted\L5-HidingRowsColumns_137363494.html)

ReportHideRowsOrColumns() is a function that allows you to hide both rows and columns when not needed. In this example, you will begin with hiding columns L, M, N, and O. To practice there is a file below that has been specifically prepared for this formula. 

  


###  [ Lab 6 Working with Pivot Tables ](/wGetStarted/L6-Working-with-Pivot-Tables_128202725.html)

Pivot tables are excellent tools to help us find answers quickly. INTERJECT can help simplify pivot table presentation and distribution. 

###  [ Lab 7 Special Column Definitions ](/wGetStarted/L7-Special-Column-Definitions_335183945.html)

Special Column Definitions are optional tags that bring out additional features to your standard column definition rows  . They are great for space savers or to allow for faster formatting of the Pulled data. 

###  [ Lab 8 Protecting Sheets ](/wGetStarted/L8-Protecting-Sheets_335151182.html)

Sheet Protection expands upon the already existing protection functions in excel but brings with it the INTERJECT UI and security rights.

###  [ Exporting Reports ](/wGetStarted/Exporting-Reports_93618178.html)

INTERJECT reports can be published or exported when needed. In most situations, INTERJECT reports are shared like a web page, where all end users have access but can only see cost centers they have rights to. Still, there are times when reports must be saved to file folders or emailed, and this section walks through the specifics of distribution and all the available methods.
