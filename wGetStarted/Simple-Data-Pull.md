##  Overview 

To clearly illustrate the end-to-end workflow of developing a report, you can begin with several simple data pull examples showing different report configurations. You will be reusing Interject reports used in previous sections, because these should be familiar to you if you read this documentation from the beginning. By the end of these sections, you will understand the process of creating spreadsheet friendly reports that can drill to other reports. 

###  Understanding The Business Use Case 

To understand the business use case for the reports and drills used in this section, please review, [ Real-World Walkthroughs - Customer Aging ](/wAbout/Customer-Aging.html). It shows a user story for the Customer Aging Report and why users would want to drill to underlying reports like Customer Orders and Aging Detail. 

Go directly to the following examples to begin each objective. It is ideal to complete the following examples in order. 

###  [ Lab Dev: Customer Aging ](/wGetStarted/L-Dev-CustomerAging.html)

On Dev: Customer Aging, you will learn how to create a simple data pull using the Customer Aging Report. To review the business use case for this report, see the [ Real World Walkthroughs - Customer Aging ](/wAbout/Customer-Aging.html).  This section begins with the steps for creating the Interject data connection and data portals, followed by the steps on how to create the stored procedure. Finally, you will be directed to another page that shows how to use the data portal to create the spreadsheet report from scratch. 

###  [ Lab Dev: Customer Orders ](/wGetStarted/L-Dev-CustomerOrders.html)

In Dev: Customer Orders, you show you how to create a second report, Customer Orders, that will be drilled to from the Customer Aging Report. You should have already seen the Customer Orders report while reviewing the business use case in [ Create: Customer Orders ](/wGetStarted/L-Create-CustomerOrders.html). Continue to build the Interject configuration and database objects to support the report.
