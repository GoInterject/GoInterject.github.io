###  Custom Tab Renaming

**Step 1:** You will add **[Location]** as a prefix and suffix for the
worksheet **("tab")** names. Type **[Location]_** in cell G15 and
**[Location]_** in H16. The underscore **_** was added to the text to allow a
spacer between the original tab name and the location value. The end result is
that the tab names will be modified as they are created so they match the
location they represent.

Prefixes and suffixes can use the values in Report Filter columns so they do
not have to be manually typed. In addition, you can use values that are set up
in Global Variable Definitions, which will be covered later.

**Step 2:** You can also type prefixes or suffixes manually, which is shown
below. Enter **Loc_7120_** in cell G17.

When the distribution is executed, the tabs should look like the image below.

**Step 3:** You can also change the tab name itself, not just add a prefix and
suffix. To do this, go back to the distribution worksheet and clear the tab
names prefix and suffix.

Once you clear the Tab Names columns, it should look like the image below.

**Step 4:** Add more practical tab names using a prefix of location that uses
a hyphen as a spacer. Type **[Location]-** in cells G15, G16 and G17.

![](attachments/128719191/129407394.png)

  

To rename the original tab name, you need to go to the Worksheet Tabs column.
At the end of the name in each of the rows 15 through 17, **[Rename:PL]** .
This will tell the distribution process to rename the original tab name to PL.

The resulting distribution looks like this:

![](attachments/128719191/129361082.png)

  

**Step 5:** If you want to add the month to the tab names, you can use the
**Add Suffix** column. Type **-[Month]** in cells H15, H16 and H17 as shown
below.

When you are finished, the distribution should appear like this:

###  Replacing Keywords Dynamically

The distribution process allows for global variables that can be used in
defining the distribution. Keywords can dynamically alter the names and
locations used by the distribution process. This allows for quick report
maintenance and also for assigning values easily from one cell change. As you
can see in the **Global Variable Definitions** , you defined **[YYYY-MM]**
with the value 2002-06. You will use that to define the **Month** filter
column so next month you can run reports for June by changing only one cell,
E36.

The resulting distribution looks the same, but now it requires less
maintenance.

###  Export Target Options

The distribution process allows a wide range of export options. The
screenshots below show the drop-down that lists all current options. These are
described in the following table.

###  Distributing Multiple Sheets

Sometimes you may want include more than one worksheet in each line of the
distribution, and it can be easily done by separating additional tab names
with a comma.

**Step 1:** To do this, navigate back to the distribution and type
**,BalanceSheet** after **ProfitAndLoss** , as shown below.

The resulting distribution looks like this.

###  Specializing Reports using Multiple Builds

Each workbook **Build** of the distribution process results in a separate
workbook. For example, you can create one report for a business director, one
for a regional manager, and another for a location manager. The director needs
to see all districts, the regional manager needs specific districts, and the
location manager needs just one location. This is easily accomplished by
creating a different **Build** with slightly different parameters for each
scenario.

In the example below, you are creating a simple workbook for the Profit and
Loss reports and a separate one for the Balance Sheets.

The first workbook looks like this:

![](attachments/128719191/129368829.png)

  

And the second workbook looks like this:

###  Grouping Segments

In the distribution examples above, each location is entered on a separate
row. Using the Grouping Segments feature, the distribution process will
automatically add new tabs in the new workbook for every item in a group. To
use this feature, the groups must be configured first. In the following
example, you are using the group **Consol** which is setup to include
locations 7001, 7002, and 7120.

**Step 1:** In the below example you will use the filter:
**[AddTabsFor]:Consol** , under the **Location** column.

![](attachments/128719191/129370765.png)

  

**Step 2:** In order to iterate through each location of the group **Consol**
, you need to change the filter name to the name of the segment. In the demo
setup, this was named **Segment** , but it would normally be named
**Location** . Due to the demo setup, you must change the filter name to
**Segment2** as shown below.

![](attachments/128719191/129209324.png)

  

**Step 3:** Now you will go back to the PL Trend tab and change the
jRangeTag() from **Location** to **Segment2** . Use of the Range Tab function
was discussed in the [ L11.2 Basic Distribution ](/wGetStarted/L11.2-Basic-
Distribution_128719024.html) lab.

![](attachments/128719191/129370903.png)

  

**Step 4:** You can also put **Segment2** in the prefix or suffix columns to
dynamically create the tab names for more organization.

![](attachments/128719191/129403150.png)

  

**Step 5:** All settings are now contained in one line. When this distribution
is run, the values for the group **Consol** are retrieved and used in
generating new tabs. Run the distribution to see how it looks.

![](attachments/128719191/129371034.png)

  

As you can see, with only one distribution row, you created a tab for each
Location in the grouping, and each tab was named with the location so that you
can quickly see which tab has which information.
