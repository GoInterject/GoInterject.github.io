##  ** Report Distribution  **

**   
** There are several options for distributing reports to help handle a company's unique needs. Sometimes a quick export is all you need for the current open report, sometimes you need to create a series of secure reports for all cost centers in specific network folders, and sometimes you need to email files to select executives. The INTERJECT distribution and export features make report distribution easy. 

It is important to note that most companies utilize the [ Report Library ](/wAbout/Report-Library-Basics_61702517.html) to publish reports, since INTERJECT allows the creation of interactive reports and applications. Like a website application, users open the spreadsheets, navigate to the data they need, and do not need to save the workbooks on their hard drive or email to a supervisor. It is a new perspective on spreadsheets that INTERJECT is building for the future. Since Report Library provides version control, the users will always be working with the latest edits. It is simply more efficient when working with data. 

Many organizations still need a static, non-interactive spreadsheet report to be distributed to users or saved in a folder. INTERJECT provides the Quick Export and Report Distribution features to facilitate this. If there are any special INTERJECT formulas in the spreadsheet  , like [ Data Cells ](/wAbout/Tabular-vs-Data-Cells_61702447.html) , these can be removed when distributed so users can view the report without INTERJECT installed. Reports can also be sent as PDFs when MS Excel is not practical. This section will illustrate how you can use these features for your needs.

This option is best for a single open report that needs to go out immediately. 

###  [ Lab 11.2 Basic Distribution ](/wGetStarted/L11.2-Basic-Distribution_128719024.html)

This covers the basics of Report Distribution. INTERJECT provides a special worksheet that you can configure for a customized set of reports that can be printed, emailed, or saved in preset file locations.

There are two options for distributing reports to users individually or in batches: Publishing and Exporting. 

###  Publishing Reports 

The most efficient means of distributing reports is publishing report templates in the [ Report Library ](/wAbout/Report-Library-Basics_61702517.html) . Report templates do not have any data; they only pull data when a credentialed user opens them. This way, users see only business units within their rights. By providing a central place for users to access versioned report templates, publishing is the most efficient way to ensure report writers and users always use the most recent report versions. Using the Report Library, INTERJECT maintains any drill connections to other reports as new versions are published. Users are still free to make their own versions, however only authorized users can publish changes back to the Report Library so others can use them.. 

###  Exporting Reports 

Exporting reports simply makes copies of a report after it has been populated with selected data. The output can be handled in a number of ways. It can be done on the fly with a single open workbook, or it can be set up to distribute a comprehensive reporting book with multiple tabs curated for each user or department. The following options are available for exporting reports. 

  


** Quick Export  ** copies a workbook while removing unwanted INTERJECT formulas. 

** Quick PDF  ** saves and opens a PDF document of the existing workbook. 

** Distribution  ** is a deeply customizable process for creating reports and distributing them in various ways. 

  


** Reporting Through Grouping Segments  ** allows for easier importing of data for larger, dynamic reports.
