![](/images/InterjectRibbon/RibbonAdvancedMenuButton.png)
<br>

The Simple Menu contains the following items:

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/RibbonSimpleMenu.png)
<br>

**Common Actions** :
[Report Library](#report-library),
[Pull Data](#pull-data),
[Save Data](#save-data),
[Drill on Data](#drill-on-data),
[Return From Drill](#return-from-drill),
[Custom Commands](#custom-commands)

**Tools** :
[Quick Tools](#quick-tools),

[Report Builder](#report-builder),
[Sheet Protector](#sheet-protector)

**User** :
[Login/Logout](#loginlogout),
[Company](#company)
[Connections](#connections),

**Updates** :
[Check for Updates](#check-for-updates)

**Help** :
[Online Training](#online-training),
[User Support](#user-support),
[About Interject](#about-interject)

* * *

### Advanced Menu Items

To display the Advanced Menu, click the **Simple Menu** button:

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/RibbonSimpleMenuButton.png)
<br>

The Advanced Menu adds the sections: User, Formulas, and Administration.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/RibbonAdvancedMenu.png)
<br>

**Formulas** :
[Validation Report](#validation-report),
[JSON](#json)

**Administration** :
[Diagnostics](#diagnostics),
[System](#system)

* * *

### Report Library

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/04.png)
<br>

For more about the Report Library, see [Report Library Basics](/wAbout/Report-Library-Basics.html).

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/05.png)
<br>

* * *

### Pull Data

The Pull Data function takes data from Data Portals and places it into an Excel report.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/06.png)
<br>

When you open the Report Library and select a report, you can either use the **Pull Data** button to retrieve the data or hit CTL-SHIFT-J. To view an example, please see [Customer Aging](/wAbout/Customer-Aging.html).

Another function of the Pull Data tool is the **Clear** operation. While the Pull brings data into the spreadsheet, this function within Pull can remove it.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/07.png)
<br>


* * *

### Save Data

Saving Data is an important part of report editing. This operation allows you to save Excel spreadsheet data back through a Data Portal and into a database or web API.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/09.png)
<br>

The **Save Data** button will run any [ReportSave()](/wFunctions/ReportSave.html) function. You can choose whether to perform this action on (S) selected cells, (T) selected tabs, or (W) the entire workbook. 

The **Show Additional Options** will give the user even greater flexibility between saving Data Cells and Data List Formulas. For more information about the difference, see [here](/wAbout/Tabular-vs-Data-Cells.html).

Below the button for **Save Data** is the **Clear Save Notes** which would clear out any of the saved notes in the report.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/SaveAdditionalOptions.png)
<br>

* * *

### Drill on Data

The Drill process opens and runs a report containing detailed information. It passes context-sensitive data from the first report to the next.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/12.png)
<br>

For more information about Drilling and Navigating, see [Drilling Between Reports.](/wGetStarted/Drilling-Between-Reports.html)

 ![](/images/InterjectRibbon/13.png)
<br>

* * *

### Return From Drill

When Drilling, the focus will change to the sheet that you are drilling to. If you want to return to the previous report, you can go back using **Return From Drill**. It works similar to a browser's back button. For an example, see [Inventory Reports](/wAbout/Inventory-Reports.html#return-from-drill-and-re-drill).

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/14.png)
<br>

* * *

### Custom Commands

The Custom Commands feature allows users to manage and run three kinds of operations: Scheduled Items, Data Cell Updates, and Custom Items.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/15.png)
<br>

* **Scheduled Items:** Run scheduled data operations
* **[Data Cell](/wAbout/Tabular-vs-Data-Cells.html#data-cells) Updates:** Displays the update history of data cells
* **[Custom Items](/wDeveloper/CustomItems.html):** Execute Custom Items that run specialized stored procedures

<br>

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/16.png)
<br>

* * *

### Quick Tools

The Quick Tools window provides a convenient set of features that increase efficiency in setting up and using reports.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/17.png)
<br>

These tools are efficient ways to complete the most common actions in Interject. Each tool has a specific purpose. For more information about the features, see [Quick Tools](/wIndex/Quick-Tools-Landing.html).

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/18.png)
<br>

* * *

### Export Book

This option will make a copy of the current workbook and convert the Data Cell formulas to values and remove external links. To read more on Exporting and Distributions, please see [Exporting Reports](/wGetStarted/Exporting-Reports.html).

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/21.png)
<br>

The Quick Export operation allows you to export any report into a new workbook, which gives you the opportunity to edit the report without compromising the original.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/22.png)
<br>

Quick PDF allows you to download the tab as a PDF in case you need to send it without the formatting.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/23.png)
<br>

When you select the Create Distribution button, it opens a sheet that allows you to build a new workbook with the information you want distributed across multiple tabs.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/24.png)
<br>

Once you have built a distribution sheet, this button runs the sheet and builds the new workbook. 

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/25.png)
<br>

* * *

### Report Builder

The Report Builder creates a sample Excel report in the current sheet based on an existing Data Portal.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/26.png)
<br>

The Report Builder offers the flexibility to build a [ReportRange](/wFunctions/ReportRange.html). For instructions on how to customize the builder, see [Report Builder](/wIndex/ReportBuilder.html). For example of using the Report Builder, see [Create: Customer Aging Report](/wGetStarted/L-Create-CustomerAging.html).

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/27.png)
<br>

* * *

### Sheet Protector

The Sheet Protector uses a list of managed passwords to protect sheets across a company. Only approved users may protect and unprotect the worksheets. For an example using the Sheet Protector, see [Create: Protecting Sheets](/wGetStarted/L-Create-Protecting.html).

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/28.png)
<br>

* * *

### Login/Logout

The Login and Logout buttons enable users to login to Interject using their Interject credentials. For more information, see [Logging In](/wAbout/Logging-In.html).

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/Login-Logout.png)
<br>

* * *

### Connections

The Connections button allows users to see a list of the connections that the report is using.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/Connections.png)
<br>

From the list, you can see all the connections associated with a company and their connection status. For more information, see [Connection Manager](/wDeveloper/ConnectionManager.html).

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/ConnectionsWindow.png)
<br>

* * *

### Company

The Company button allows user to switch companies they currently want to work in. Each company a user is enrolled in will allow them access to different sets of documents via the [Report Library](/wAbout/Report-Library-Basics.html) and [Data Portals](/wPortal/Data-Connections.html).

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/Company.png)
<br>

* * *

### Validation Report

The Validation Report operation allows you to check the code for Saves, Pulls, Drills, and other actions. For more information about the options here, see [Validation Report](/wTroubleshoot/Validation-Report.html).

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/31.png)
<br>

* * *

### JSON

In the Interject Ribbon you can decide whether to show JSON or not. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the readable code Interject uses to structure the data moving between a server and a web application.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/33.png)
<br>

* * *

### Diagnostics

This option opens a configuration menu to manage diagnostics settings and send data to the Interject Support Team.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/34.png)
<br>

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/35.png)
<br>

### Check For Updates

Checks for updates to the Interject Add-in. This applies to installations downloaded from the website. If an IT department installed Interject on a network, there is no need to check for updates. For more information, see [Updating Interject](/wAbout/Updating-INTERJECT.html).

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/38.png)
<br>

This option allows users to look for new versions of the Interject Excel Add-in. Notifications will show when new versions of Interject are available.

![](/images/InterjectRibbon/39.png)
