##  **Overview**

The report library is a way to share reports with other users on the team. The reports are uploaded to the library and can be accessed from any other computer using Excel and INTERJECT. INTERJECT spreadsheets can still be organized within Sharepoint or network folders, but INTERJECT provides an easy versioning and release system to help ensure adequate controls. And it is available directly from within Excel. 

**Note:** Before beginning this walk-through, it is important to review the [ Report Library Basics ](/wAbout/Report-Library-Basics_61702517.html) .

###  Saving a New Version 

**Step 1:** To save a new version, you will first make sure the report is saved. Be sure the workbook is cleared of its data, since the Report Library is only designed to share blank report templates and not reports that have user data. Select the File menu shown below.

Click **Save As** , and  choose a location where the file will be saved. If this file has already saved, you can simply choose **Save** . It is recommend that when updating a new version of the report, the file name should be slightly different that the previous version. Although not shown in the below example, often a version suffix like **FileName_v2.xlsx** is considered best practice.

**Step 5:** After the file is selected, you can edit the details of the report in the Report Library Link detail window that is shown below. 

  1. Select a status from the dropdown menu. 
    1. _Live_ : Standard users can only see live reports, so only use this when the report is ready to be published. 
    2. _Test_ : In testing means the development is complete and is in the testing status. 
    3. _Dev_ : In development by the report writers. 
    4. _Superseded_ : This is a report that is no longer used but still available to admin users for review. 
  2. Optionally, you can choose to enter a Version Name  and make a small note on the changes made. The note only allows 30 characters. 
  3. Notice the Link Path is the same as the current file that was saved in earlier steps. It is recommended that you use new file names for newer versions of the report.

###  Adding a Drill Code to a Report 

Drill Codes are important when using the INTERJECT report drill feature discussed in the section [ Drilling Between Reports ](/wGetStarted/Drilling-Between-Reports_61702193.html) . Drill Codes are needed when a drill needs to go to a separate workbook, and that workbook is saved in the Report Library. 

**Step 1:** To add Drill Codes to a report, you can amend the above steps and add drill codes to the Report Link Details window, as seen below. The Drill Codes must be unique to others that were saved prior. A report can have up to three drill codes, each pointing to different worksheet tabs. More are allowed, but you must contact INTERJECT for assistance.
