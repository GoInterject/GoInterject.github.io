##  Overview

Now that you know how to modify reports, you can take it one step further. In this section, you will create an Interject report completely from scratch. To make things easy, recreate a sheet from our previous examples that you are already familiar with. 

### [Customer Aging Report](/wGetStarted/L-Create-CustomerAging.html)

You will go through the process of building a Customer Aging report from scratch. It is a simple range report that will clearly illustrate how to use the  [ReportRange()](/wFunctions/ReportRange.html) formula. 

### [Customer Orders Report](/wGetStarted/L-Create-CustomerOrders.html)

This example walks through creating a Customer Orders report that is slightly different than the last. It's another good example of  the  [ReportRange()](/wFunctions/ReportRange.html) formula but uses two rows for each record to provide a more comprehensive presentation.
