###  [ Lab Create: Customer Aging Example ](/wGetStarted/L-Create-CustomerAging.html)

You will go through the process of building a Customer Aging report from scratch. It is a simple range report that will clearly illustrate how to use the  [ ReportRange() ](/wIndex/ReportRange.html) formula. 

###  [ Lab Create: Customer Orders ](/wGetStarted/L-Create-CustomerOrders.html)

This example walks through creating a Customer Orders report that is slightly different than the last. It's another good example of  the  [ ReportRange() ](/wIndex/ReportRange.html) formula but uses two rows for each record to provide a more comprehensive presentation.
