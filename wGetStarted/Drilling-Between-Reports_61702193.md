##  **Overview**

  


The INTERJECT drill feature allows you to connect individual reports together to make a simple, fast, and intuitive experience for users to get to the data they use everyday. In this walk-through you will view drilling between reports with the same reports used in the previously viewed [ Real-World Walkthroughs ](/wAbout/Real-World-Walkthroughs_128091006.html) . 

###  [ Lab 4.1 Drill: Customer Aging Report ](/wGetStarted/128421015.html)

In this lab, you will be setting up a simple drill to the customer orders history. It's a great use case for creating the first drill. 

###  [ Lab 4.2 Drill: Inventory Report ](/wGetStarted/128409138.html)

In this lab, you will setup a drill between the **Inventory by Category** and **Inventory by Detail** pages of the workbook. Then you will set up a hyperlink for the drill so it's more intuitive for the user.
