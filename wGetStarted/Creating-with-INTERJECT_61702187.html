  <p>
   INTERJECT reports can be published or exported when needed. In most situations, INTERJECT reports are shared like a web page, where all end users have access but can only see cost centers they have rights to. Still, there are times when reports must be saved to file folders or emailed, and this section walks through the specifics of distribution and all the available methods.
