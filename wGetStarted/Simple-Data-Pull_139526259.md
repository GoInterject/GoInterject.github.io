##  Overview

To clearly illustrate the end-to-end workflow of developing a report, you can
begin with several simple data pull examples showing different report
configurations. You will be reusing INTERJECT reports used in previous
sections, because these should be familiar to you if you read this
documentation from the beginning. By the end of these sections, you will
understand the process of creating spreadsheet friendly reports that can drill
to other reports.

###  Understanding The Business Use Case

To understand the business use case for the reports and drills used in this
section, please review, **[ Real-World Walkthroughs - Customer Aging
](/wAbout/Customer-Aging_128091294.html) ** . It shows a user story for the
Customer Aging Report and why users would want to drill to underlying reports
like Customer Orders and Aging Detail.

Go directly to the following examples to begin each objective. It is ideal to
complete the following examples in order.

###  [ Lab 12.1 Dev: Customer Aging ](/wGetStarted/324567045.html)

On Dev: Customer Aging, you will learn how to create a simple data pull using
the Customer Aging Report. To review the business use case for this report,
see the  **[ Real World Walkthroughs - Customer Aging ](/wAbout/Customer-
Aging_128091294.html) ** .  This section begins with the steps for creating
the INTERJECT data connection and data portals, followed by the steps on how
to create the stored procedure. Finally, you will be directed to another page
that shows how to use the data portal to create the spreadsheet report from
scratch.

###  [ Lab 12.2 Dev: Customer Orders ](/wGetStarted/324403205.html)

In Dev: Customer Orders, you show you how to create a second report, Customer
Orders, that will be drilled to from the Customer Aging Report. You should
have already seen the Customer Orders report while reviewing the business use
case in [ Create: Customer Orders ](/wGetStarted/128421638.html) . Continue to
build the INTERJECT configuration and database objects to support the report.
