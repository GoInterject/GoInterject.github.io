###  Pull Data 

The Pull Data function takes data from Data Portals and places it into an Excel report.

When you open the Report Library and select a report, you can either use the Pull Data button to retrieve the data or hit Ctrl-Shift-J. To view an example, please click [ here ](https://interject.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ID/Real-World+Walkthroughs) .

When you select the Create Distribution button, it opens a sheet that allows you to build a new workbook with the information you want distributed across multiple tabs. 

![](attachments/83689479/129435977.png?width=495)

  


Once you have built a distribution sheet, this button runs the sheet and builds the new workbook.  ![](attachments/83689479/129435865.png?width=497)

The Advanced menu allows you to move deeper into INTERJECT Reports.

Once selected, the INTERJECT Ribbon expands, changes the button for Advanced Menu to Simple Menu, and adds the following sections: Validation Report, JSON, Diagnostcs, and Systems. Because these features are used less commonly than the previous ones, we have given users the option hide them from the toolbar.
