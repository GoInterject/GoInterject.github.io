##  **Overview**

An important part of the INTERJECT platform is the ability to collect data from spreadsheet reports in order to add or modify that data centrally. It can turn normal reports into interactive applications that users can easily adopt to speed up workflow. This section will walk through creating a simple data save. It is recommended you complete the previous sections before continuing.
