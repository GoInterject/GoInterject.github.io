##  Overview

### [Customer Aging Report](/wGetStarted/L-Modify-CustomerAging.html)

In this example, you will use the same report used in the [Customer Aging Summary Report Walk-through](/wAbout/Customer-Aging.html), except here you will be adding a total for the invoices due from each company along with a grand total of all the invoices due in this report. 

### [Inventory Report](/wGetStarted/L-Modify-InventoryReport.html)  

In this example you will be customizing the inventory report used in the [Inventory Real-World case](/wAbout/Inventory-Reports.html). You will be deleting and adding back a category row and adding a new column. 

### [Financial Report](/wGetStarted/L-Modify-FinancialReport.html)

In this example you will use the same file presented in the [Financial Report Walk-through](/wAbout/Financial-Report.html), although now you are going to show further details on how the modification is done.
