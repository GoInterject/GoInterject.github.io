##  **Overview**

Many times in creating a report you don't have to start from scratch. Often it
is faster to start with an existing report and make the modifications you
need. On this page, you will read through three scenarios in which modifying a
report might be needed.  Go directly to any walk-through by clicking one of
the links below.

###  [ Lab 1.1 Modify: Customer Aging Report ](/wGetStarted/128428927.html)

In this example, you will use the same report used in the [ Customer Aging
Summary Report Walk-through ](/wAbout/Customer-Aging_128091294.html) , except
here you will be adding a total for the invoices due from each company along
with a grand total of all the invoices due in this report.

###  [ Lab 1.2 Modify: Inventory Report ](/wGetStarted/128429185.html) _[
](https://interject.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ID/Modify%3A+Inventory+Report)
_

In this example you will be customizing the inventory report used in the [
Inventory Real-World case ](/wAbout/Inventory-Reports_128091499.html) . You
will be deleting and adding back a category row and adding a new column. _

###  [ Lab 1.3 Modify: Financial Report ](/wGetStarted/128429053.html)

In this example you will use the same file presented in the [ Financial Report
Walk-through  ](/wAbout/Financial-Report_128091561.html) , although now you
are going to show further details on how the modification is done.
