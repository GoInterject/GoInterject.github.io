##  **Overview**

For this drill example you will use the **PL Trend** that was previously
reviewed in the [ Financial Report - Walkthrough ](/wAbout/Financial-
Report_128091561.html) . This time you will be drilling to a separate workbook
instead of drilling to another worksheet in the same workbook. This can be
very useful when there is a common report, such as one that shows general
ledger detail, that can be used as a drill from several different reports and
workbooks. You will be viewing that same example with the JE  (Journal Entry)
Query drill report.

###  Unfreezing the Report

**Step 1** : For this example you will be using a modified [ PL trend report
](https://interject.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ID/pages/128091561/Financial+Report)
, which can be download here [ Demo_Interject_PLTrend.xlsx
](/wGetStarted/128409219.html) . This report has been prepared specifically
for this exercise.

** Step 2:  ** To unfreeze the panels, go to the **View** tab, find the
**Freeze Pane** option, and select **Unfreeze Panes** .

** Step 3:  ** For this example, type in **7002** for the location in M21. And
type **2002-05** for the month in cell M22.

###  Building The Drill

Continue setting up the drill formula.

**Step 1:** In cell G17, type **=[ ReportDrill() ](/wIndex/61702556.html) ** .
Column G is fairly narrow, but it will simply overlap the cells to the right.
Then click the **fx** button as illustrated below to bring up the Function
Wizard.

**Step 2:** In previous drill exercises you have used the ReportCellToRun
argument. That is only for drilling within the same workbook. In this example
you are drilling to a separate workbook. Type **Interject_JEQuery** into the
ReportCodeToRun argument as seen below. The Drill Code **Interject_JEQuery**
was setup previously by adding the code to a Report Library report. You will
learn how to setup a Drill Code in the page [ L10 Updating the Report Library
](/wGetStarted/L10-Updating-the-Report-Library_62849583.html) later.

**Step 3:** Next you will use the  TransferPairs argument to note which cell
values in the source worksheet will be transferred to the target worksheet
during the drill operation. To do this, use special functions to pair the
source cells to the target cells. Type  **[ PairGroup(Pair())
](/wIndex/81756186.html) ** in the TransferPairs argument to get it started.
You will return to add more to this argument.

**Step 4:** In the Formula Bar, click within the word **Pair()** inside the
text **PairGroup(Pair())** . See the illustration below. Once this is done,
the Function Wizard will automatically change to help with the Pair()
function. Type **L12:N12** in the From argument. This is the row that will
indicate which month the user was on when the drill was activated and it will
pass it to the target worksheet  .

![](attachments/128409219/129734553.png)

  

**Step 5:** Now, type **DateBegin** in the Target argument to establish the
target cell that will receive the month. **DateBegin** is a Named Range in the
target sheet. Named Ranges are used in MS Excel to assign a name to a specific
cell, such as G15. You use Named Ranges in your drill in case rows or columns
are changed in the target worksheet where the address of the target cell
changes. By using Named Ranges, the drill will continue to find the correct
cell to place the month into.

**Step 6:** Now, type **True** in the RequireValue argument because the From
value must exist to trigger the drill. There would be no point in drilling to
the target report without filtering for a specific month. The **True** value
is not required since, if left blank, **True** is assumed. Since this drill
exercise will have other Pairs() that are not required, it is good practice to
specify it explicitly in this case.

Note the next argument, ScopeRange, is not used. It is an outdated argument.

**Step 7:** Now that you understand how to define a Pair, you have many more
to create. The target report has several filters that make use easier when
employed separately and in drilling to the report. You need to add a few more
values to pass to the new report and clear the remaining filters that are not
used in this drill. This is a key concept for INTERJECT drills. A report can
be used by itself for its own purpose, but it can also be used as a drill from
other reports.

Now let's use the Function Wizard to edit the PairGroup() function by clicking
on it in the Formula Bar as seen below. This will make it easier to create
more Pairs() that will clear out the other filters in the target report.

![](attachments/128409219/129354915.png)

  

**Step 8:** You have two more values to pass, the Location and the Account.
Type **Pair(M21,"Segment2",TRUE)** into Pair2, which will pass the Location
into the next report, and type **Pair(F26:F125,"Segment1",TRUE)** into Pair3,
which will pass the Account or Account Group into the next report.

![](attachments/128409219/129355415.png)

  

**Step 9:** You need to make sure the other filters in the target report do
not interfere with the drill, so you will set this next group of Pair()
functions to bring over blank values. In the Pair() functions you are going to
set the From arguments to blank (""), and you will make the RequireValue
argument **FALSE** . Both steps 9 and 10 are adding Pair functions that clear
out the unused filters. This is best practice, but steps 9 and 10 can be
skipped since it will not impact the limited scope of this exercise.

Enter the following pairs as shown below:  
**Pair("","DateEnd",FALSE)** into Pair4

**Pair("","Segment3",FALSE)** into Pair5

**Pair("","Segment4",FALSE)** into Pair 6

**Pair("","AccountDesc",FALSE)** Into Pair7

**Pair("","TypeDesc",FALSE)** Into Pair8

![](attachments/128409219/129356073.png)

  

**Step 10:** There are still more filters to blank out for the target report.
Continuing typing the following.

**Pair("All","Posting",FALSE)** into Pair9

**Pair("","VendorCode",FALSE)** into Pair10

**Pair("","AmountFrom",FALSE)** into Pair11

**Pair("","AmountTo",FALSE)** into Pair12

**Pair("","Organization",FALSE)** into Pair13 **  
![](attachments/128409219/129356730.png) **

  

There are two more pairs to enter. Scroll down and type:

**Pair("","Company",FALSE)** into Pair 14

**Pair("","FullAccount",FALSE))** into Pair 15.

After these, you are through adding the Pair() functions.

![](attachments/128409219/129356814.png)

  

**Step 11:** You need to name the drill so it is clear for the users. Click on
G17 and select the **fx** to bring up the Function Wizard. Input **Drill To
JEQuery - Account** into the DrillName and select OK to finish creating the
drill.

![](attachments/128409219/129356913.png)

  

When you click away from TransferPairs, it shows a red **#NAME** ? to the
right of the input area. That looks like an error, but it is simply a small
bug in Microsoft Excel, which will hopefully be addressed.

**Step 12:** You successfully created a Drill to the Journal Entry Query
report from the financial report. Test it out.

###  Executing the Drill

**Step 1:** Use **[ Pull Data ](/wPortal/INTERJECT-Ribbon-Menu-
Items_83689479.html) ** to pull the report. You can leave the panes open for
the moment. They will not affect the drill feature.

![](attachments/128409219/129434635.png)

  

**Step 2:** Scroll down to the **Revenue - Sales** row on line 32 and click
the plus sign so it expands to show the accounts. There should be several
accounts listed as shown below.

![](attachments/128409219/129367046.png)

  

**Step 3:** Click the amount $20,900 which is for account 32000 in May 2005.
You can then use the keystroke **Ctrl Shift K** or use the **Drill on Data**
menu item to bring up the drill options.

![](attachments/128409219/129434695.png)

  

Notice that if you close the drill window and try to drill on column O, there
will not be any drill options. The work you did above helped set the scope so
the drill only works on the appropriate cells.

![](attachments/128409219/129434726.png)

  

**Step 3:** The animated GIF below shows the drill completed. The panes are
frozen again. The drill selects the amount for account 33000 for March 2002,
then does the drill on amount 44,474. The JE Query report provides the detail
to support the same amount.
