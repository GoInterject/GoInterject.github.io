[{"title":"Adding Notes To A Report","url":"/bApps/bFinancials/AddingNotes.html","content":"Adding a notes column that saves back to a database is a multi-step process. First, you'll set up a column for the data will be placed. Then, you'll add two report formulas to manipulate the data, and lastly, you'll structure the report formulas to point to the various data within the report so it saves and pulls comments. Report Setup First, unfreeze the panes for your report. Now expand the top grouping to show columns A-C. Then, if a comments column doesn't exist in your report, insert a column as the rightmost column of your report. Label it Comments. Insert a column to the right of Column B (or the row definitions column) and insert RowDefName in row 2. NOTE: The RowDefName Column must be one column to the right of the Row Definitions for your main report pull function. Then, insert 4 rows above the report formulas row. Make rows 10 and 12 dark blue and label them \"Column Definitions - Notes - Get\", and \"Column Definitions - Notes - Save\", respectively. In cells C11, E11, M11 and N11 insert Segment5, Segment1, NoteText, [Clear] respectively. Next, in cells C13, E13, M13, and N13 insert Segment5, Segment1, NoteText, and MessageToUser respectively. NOTE: If you usehave other dimensions in the report, you can use Segment2, Segment3, Segment4 respectively. Additionally, the cells in which these column definitions are placed MUST align with the column definitions in row 2. Now, insert two rows below row 19. In cell E20 input Notes Get: and in cell G20 input =ReportFixed(). Then, select cell G20, and select the fx button. Now input the following values for each field: DataPortal = ERP_Note_Fixed_Get RowDefRange = C70:E171 ColDefRange = 11:11 Parameters = Param(,G64,,,,,,G65,MONTH(FiscalPeriod),YEAR(FiscalPeriod)) This uses a two column approach to the RowDefRange for this specific formula, which means it will create a unique combined key for the data to be searched on. Ultimately, it forces each record to be indexed by that unique key for each row within the ReportFixed() function. NOTE: The param function and the param field the values represented are one-to-one ordered mappings from a segment to a filter on the report. This means that the first parameter in the Param function represents segment1. So what you are passing to the segment is the filter value for your report. Your report may have different filters and will need to be ordered according to your report specifically. The values given here are suitable for the example report. In cell E21 insert Notes Save: and in cell G21 =ReportSave(). Next, select cell G21, then select the fx button and input the following values for each field: DataPortal = ERP_Note_Save RowDefRange = C71:C169 ColDefRange = 13:13 ResultsRange = N13 Parameters = Param(,G64,,,,,,G65,MONTH(FiscalPeriod),YEAR(FiscalPeriod)) As opposed to the ReportFixed() function, the ReportSave() only uses a singular column for the RowDefRange. This is because a save does not need the unique key to save values back, since it has the capability to save data that has a many-to-one relationship between row identifiers and the data. However, when pulling that data back out, the pull function (in this case the ReportFixed) does need a unique identifier to determine which data belongs to which key, as well as where to place it. NOTE: The param function in the param field the values represented are one-to-one ordered mappings from a segment to a filter on the report. This means that the first parameter in the Param function represents segment1. So what you are passing to the segment is the filter value for your report. Your report may have different filters and will need to be ordered according to your report specifically. The values given here are suitable for the example report. Be aware that Param position 9 is typically used for the month of the fiscal period, and Param position 10 is typically used for the year of the fiscal period. Adding Summary Level Comments To be able to add comments on your summary level labels, you will need to add into column C Excel formulas that link the summary level rows to the grouping/row definitions in column B. As seen in the example below, cell C78 points to cell B76.

This tool can be downloaded and customized in your local environment. Filters Template Setup The Build Based On and Account Level filters are used to set up the template. They determine where initial data is pulled from and at what level the district will be budgeted. Once data is pulled, filters will be hidden from the report. Build Based On Required. There is a drop-down filter that includes Retain User Input, Last Saved/Upload, Base Year and \"Reset(Clear All Data)\". This parameter controls what data is pulled and what is cleared on a pull in the YYYY Budget Input section. Each selection is explained in detail below. Retain User Input - After the initial run/pull, the Build Based On parameter will automatically be set to Retain User Input, preserving any file changes. Values in the YYYY Budget Input section and formulas entered by the user will not be overridden. This is the default parameter after an initial run/pull. Last Saved/Upload - This will bring the last saved amounts into the YYYY Budget Input section. It will replace and/or clear values and formulas that haven't been saved. Base Year - This will bring in the \"Base Year\" amounts just as the YYYY Actuals & Projections section does into the YYYY Budget Input section. It will replace and/or clear any values and formulas that haven't been saved. Reset (Clear All Data) - This will clear all data related to the distict, including from the budget user input section. When running this option, select \"Clear\" in the \"Pull Datal Control\" window. Account Level Required. Used in pulling data to determine the default account level at which the detail is summarized. The drop-down filter includes the choice of Summary (xxxxx) or Full GL Account (xxxxx-xxx-xx). Summary (xxxxx) will summarize detail at the natural account level. Full GL Account (xxxxx-xxx-xx) will show Account, System, and Sub-System. Other Required Filters The following additional required and optional filters are described below: District - Required. Designates the individual district. You cannot use district ranges or groupings. Budget Year - Required. The year currently being budgeted for. Base Year - Required. Used in the pull. The drop-down filter ranges from Aug Proj -> Dec Act Additional Filters Retain Comments - Required. This drop-down filter includes Yes and No. If you choose Yes, pulling on the report will not clear unsaved comments. Currency - Optional. Blank defaults to your home district currency. Other options are USD and CAD. Insert at End - Required. Drop-down filter includes Yes and No. If set to Yes, new accounts get added at the bottom of their grouping. Input Field Explanations Base Year and Fincube The Base Year drop-down filter changes how Actuals and Projections for the current year are pulled in from Fincube. For example, the screenshot below shows the Aug Proj option, which pulled in Actuals from January -> July, and Projections from August -> December. If we change the Base Year to Aug Act, August will pull in as Actual instead. How Templates Work When coming into the template, users will have the option to set the starting point by selecting how data is popuated into YYYY Budget Inputs, as well as the Account Level at which the detail is populated. Once the report is pulled these filter options will no longer be avalible. If a new account is added to the Template, how Insert at End is set dictates whether the account gets placed normally, in order, or gets inserted at the end. For example, if 50045-600-00 is added to the Template while Insert at End is set to No, it is placed between the 50036 and 50050 accounts. Summary and Detail level accounts A new feature to the Budget Template is the ability to pull/save to Detail and Summary level accounts at the same time. Pulling Summary and Detail levels together Since rows are retained by default, even after you've chosen the Summary template you can still add detail rows. Simply insert additional rows beneath the account, copy the row to include the formulas and enter the system and subsystem values in thier respective columns. The data will populate when the report is pulled again. In the screenshot below, we see four account combinations for the 36009 account. And after the data is pulled, we see those rows populated Saving Summary and Detail levels together When saving with Summary and Detail level accounts on the same template, the Summary level accounts are saved to the 000-00 version of the summarized account. Any missing detail level accounts already in the database will be zeroed out. Things to Remember If you delete other accounts from the template, they will be zeroed out as well (even if they do not have a summary level account present in the template). When saving with a Summary level account (only Acct is present), you cannot also save to the same account with 000-00 included. The save thinks the two accounts are the same, and they will be marked as duplicates. The Autocalcs The majority of accounts in your template will be marked Manual Input in the Bud Method column (column J). Some of the other accounts will have something different in this column and are considered Autocalcs. There are many different types of Autocalcs, but the main thing to know is that you cannot edit them with the Budget Template. These accounts are managed by Corporate. Notice also that any Manual Input account is highlighted yellow, and the Autocalcs are grayed out. Autocalc Handling It is best practice to set your Autocalc input columns to equal the last saved columns from Interject. That way your your inputs will automatically update when assumptions are changed, and your EBITDA will tie out. Do I have security rights to Save from the Budget Template? To find if you can save to the Budget Template, please check out the Tools Controlled by the Control Center page. After Corp Cutoff and after BOD After Corp Cutoff If you save to Budget After Corp Cutoff, the numbers will still be updated in Target Center 2.0. However, they will not be synced through to Interject. In this example, the Corp Cutoff date in Control Center is set to 11/3/2018. We then try and upload a change to Budget using the Budget Template tool (after this date), and get the following popup message. Notice our changes have been saved to Target Center 2.0, but they are not yet synced to Interject. Once the Corp Cutoff date is set to a Date/Time after our change or BOD, this change will be synced to Interject. We can use the the new UnsyncedChanges in the Budget Change Query Tool tab to see our changes in Target Center 2.0. After BOD Once BOD for a Budget Year has been created, any save from the Budget Template will not automatically sync to Interject again, just like After Corp Cutoff. While it is not in Interject, it is in Target Center 2.0 and can be checked using the UnsyncedChanges tab in the Budget Change Query Tool. Once Corporate has versioned your change, the Budget amount will be sycned through to Interject. Common Save Errors The template you are using is not current. You need to get a new template from the Report Library. The district is locked at a level higher than what you have access to. Work with your supervisor to unlock the file to your level. Other Possible Save Errors You last pulled for a district different from the one you are trying to save to. You need to repull for the district you want to save for with Retain Rows set to No. Be sure to make a copy to transfer your notes/amounts over. You need to use a valid District in the District parameter. The YearMonth is required and needs to be in the YYYY-MM format. Your save updated Target Center 2.0 but is not synced to Interject yet. Once Corp Cutoff is updated to after your change or BOD is created, it will then be synced to Interject. Your local template is missing some of the required columns. Get a fresh copy of the template for the library, or reach out to support to fix your template. The Account on the specified row is not a valid Account. The Syst on the specified row is not a valid Syst. The Sbst on the specified row is not a valid Sbst. The amount in the provided column for the given row is non-numeric and needs to be fixed (Proj12 = Bud12) There is a rounding error in the provided column for the given row, and needs to be fixed (Proj12 = Bud12) Two of your rows have the same Account combination listed. It could be that one row is on the summarized level and you have the detail version 000-00 as well. There is a broken formula in the provided column for the given row, and needs to be fixed (Period 1 = Bud1) "},{"title":"Budget Template Summary","url":"/bApps/InterjectTraining/Budget/BudgetTemplateSummary.html","content":"Overview Purpose: The Budget Template tools are used by controllers to update their Budgets on the District level.

Drop-down filter includes Yes and No. For Yes, accounts missing from the template are zeroed out. For No, missing accounts will keep their amounts, and any Summary level accounts are offsetted to include the missing accounts automatically. Input Field Explanations Base Year and Fincube The Base Year drop-down filter changes how Actuals and Projections for the current year are pulled in from Fincube. For example, the screenshot below shows the Aug Proj option, which pulled in Actuals from January -> July, and Projections from August -> December. If we change the Base Year to Aug Act, August will pull in as Actual instead. Retain Rows and how it works With Retain Rows on Yes, any inputs in the Input columns will remain when the template is refreshed, or even if the report is cleared. If it is No, the Input columns will copu either the Budgets saved to the current Budget Year or last Year' (depending on the alternative option). For and example with Retain Rows Yes, the screenshot below shows a formula used on the 50020-600-00 account. We clear the report, and afterwards we see that not only have all of the rows remain, but the formula is still there. The Retain Comments on Yes will keep any comments saved in the template, even if there are different comments saved in the database. If a new account is added to the Template with Retain Rows set to Yes, the setting for Insert at End dictates if the new account is added where it would normally go or get inserted at the end. For example, if 50045-600-00 is added to the Template while Insert at End is set to No, it is nestled between the 50035 and 50050 accounts. Otherwise if Insert at End is set to Yes, the added account is added at the bottom. Use this if you use formulas, so that newly added accounts do not mess them up. Things to Remember After the first pull, the Retain Rows will automatically be set to Yes, to preserve your file changes. Summary and Detail level accounts A new feature to the Budget Template is the ability to pull/save to Detail and Summary level accounts at the same time. Pulling Summary and Detail levels together On the pull, the Insert By Full Acct drop-down option dictates if the missing accounts are added on the Summary or Detail level. When Retain Rows is set to Yes, this permits you to pull in accounts on a different level than the ones you already have in your template. Let's go through the following example. In the screenshot below, we see four account combinations for the 36009 account. With Retain Rows set to Yes and Insert By Full Acct set to No, we delete the 36009-000-00 and 36009-600-00 rows. When we pull on the tool now, the two detail rows 36009-000-00 and 36009-600-00 are summarized into one row, with the account header of 36009 alone. 36009-000-00 had $1,000 amounts for all months, and 36009-600-00 had $2,000 for all months. Together they have $3,000 for all months. Things to Remember For this to work, Retain Rows MUST be set to Yes. Otherwise, if Retain Rows is set to No and you pull, it will pull in ALL accounts on the Detail Level. Saving Summary and Detail levels together When saving with Summary and Detail level accounts on the same template, the Summary level accounts are saved to the 000-00 version of the summarized account. Depending on the Zero Out Missing Accts setting, the Detail level accounts already in the database will either be zeroed out or remain unaltered. Let's use the example accounts we used from earlier. Let's update the summarized account for 36009 to $3,500 for all months. First we save with Zero Out Missing Accts set to No, and pull in all detail rows by setting Retain Rows to No and Insert By Full Acct to Yes. The Budget saved to 36009-000-00 is the offset of $3,500 per month (summarized amount) and $2,000 per month for 36009-600-00 (amounts in database). This updated the $1,000 in the database 36009-000-00 to $1,500, so that the summarize amount matches what was saved AND preserves the amount already assigned to 36009-600-00. If we had set Zero Out Missing Accts set to Yes instead, the pull on detail would have looked like this instead. Now 36009-000-00 has the full $3,500 for each month, and 36009-600-00 has been zeroed out because it was not in the template. Things to Remember If there are other accounts you delete from your template, they will be zeroed out as well if Zero Out Missing Accts is set to Yes (even if they do not have summary level account present in the template). When saving with a Summary level account (only Acct is present), you cannot also save to the same account with 000-00 included. The save thinks the two accounts are the same, and will be marked as duplicates. The Autocalcs The majority of accounts in your template will be marked Manual Input in the Bud Method column (column J). Some of the other accounts will have something different in this column, and are considered Autocalcs. There are many different types of Autocalcs, but the main thing to know is that you cannot edit them with the Budget Template. These accounts are managed by Corporate. Notice also that any Manual Input account is highlighted yellow, and the Autocalcs are grayed out. Do I have security rights to Save from the Budget Template? Only people in the District Position Assignment (DPA) for the District in Toolbox can save to this file. Your Division Controller can add you if you are not already in the DPA. Budget Template and the Control Center Based on your position in the DPA for the district, you will have a certain level of access to this report. The types of levels you may be on are: A/C, Dist, Div, Reg, or Corp. Budget is locked at these levels in the Control Center, in the N column. In the example below, District 2050 is locked at the Reg Level. If an A/C level user tried saving to 2050 Budget, they would be stopped with the following message. You are able to save Budget as long as the Budget lock level is your level or below. Otherwise you will not be able to save Budget. After Corp Cutoff and after BOD After Corp Cutoff If you save to Budget After Corp Cutoff, the numbers will still be updated in Target Center 2.0. However, they will not be synced through to Interject. In this example, the Corp Cutoff date in Control Center is set to 11/3/2018. We then try and upload a change to Budget using the Budget Template tool (after this date), and get the following popup message. So our changes here have been saved to Target Center 2.0, but they are not yet synced to Interject. Once the Corp Cutoff date is set to a Date/Time after our change or BOD, this change will then be synced to Interject. We can use the the new tab UnsyncedChanges in the Budget Change Query Tool to see our changes in Target Center 2.0. After BOD Once BOD for a Budget Year has been created, then any save from the Budget Template will not automatically sync to Interject again. This is just like with After Corp Cutoff, and while it is not in Interject it is in Target Center 2.0, and can be checked using the UnsyncedChanges tab in the Budget Change Query Tool . Once Corporate has versioned your change, the Budget amount will be sycned through to Interject. Common Save Errors The template you are using is not current. You need to grab a new template from the Report Library. The district is locked at a level higher than what you have access for. Work with your supervisor to unlock the file to your level. Other Possible Save Errors You last pulled for a district different from the one you are trying to save to. You need to repull for the district you want to save for with Retain Rows set to No. Be sure to make a copy to copy your notes/amounts over.

If a file has not been saved to a given Budget or Projections Template, or you want to make a fresh one, you can drill on either section to create a new Template. Lock Levels and District Position Assignment The Control Center manages the lock levels for the Budget, Capital, and Projections modules. The possible lock levels are: Ops, A/C, Dist, Div, Reg, or Corp. Your level of access is determined by your position in the District Position Assignment (DPA). This can be found in the toolbox at the following location: In the screenshot below, notice the lock level for Budget is Dist Level. IF your permissions are high enough, you can change the Lock Level for Budgets. In this case, since it is locked at Dist Level, you need to be at Dist level or higher in the DPA. If you have a high enough level, the Lock Level drop-down will show all levels up to your yours, plus one more to send it up once you are done. The screenshot below is for a Dist level user who can lock the Budget up to the Div Level. If a Dist level user locks the Budget up to Div level (usually done once Budget is ready for review), they will be locked out. If more changes are needed, they will need to work with a supervisor to unlock it back down to Dist level. Contract Center Lock Status The Contract Center in Toolbox is locked based on the Budget Lock Level for the District in Control Center. If the Budget Lock Level is Reg Level or higher, Contract Center will be locked and you will not be able to edit. Budget Review Dates The Budget Review Dates are used to version the budget amounts from Target Center 2.0 as they are synced into Interject. The four Budget Review Date options are: Corp Review Thru, Reg Review Thru, Reg Cutoff, and Corp Cutoff. When a budget amount is synced to Interject, it will fall into one of these four Review Date Buckets. If an amount is saved before or at 7/1/2019 5:00 PM, that amount will be placed in the Corp Review Thru Bucket. If a budget amount is saved after that time but before or at 7/31/2019 5:00 PM, it will be placed in the Corp Cutoff Bucket. This organization is repeated for the two remaining buckets. AFTER CORP CUTOFF If a budget amount is saved AFTER Corp Cutoff, it will NOT be synced to Interject. It will remain only in Target Center 2.0. Do I have rights to change the Review Dates? If you have Reg Level access to a district, you can update the Reg Review Thru and Reg Cutoff dates. If you have Corp Level access to a district, you can update all of the Review Dates. Review Dates Example To see how this works in real time, we'll save an amount to a Budget Template. For this example, we'll save $100 to an account on 10/1/2019 3:30 PM. According to our Control Center Budget Review Dates (see earlier screenshot), 10/1/2019 3:30 PM is after Reg Cutoff but before Corp Cutoff. This means that the $100 will be placed in the Corp Cutoff Bucket. We can double check this in two places: The Budget Change Query Tool and the Budget Book. In Budget Change Query Tool , we look on the first tab ReviewDateSummary, pulling on the same District and Year. The Budget Change Query Tool pulls in amounts saved to TC 2.0, and here we see the amount in the correct bucket. Next, look at the Budget Book, which shows the amounts saved to Interject. First, on the Summary tab we set Versions to Corp Cutoff. We also set the In Districts and Budget Year to correspond with what we are using. Now go to the 4_BudSumByMonth tab and pull. Since we're pulling on the Corp Cutoff version, we see the $100 go into the correct account grouping. Going back to the Summary tab, we change the Versions filter to Reg Cutoff. Back on the 4_BudSumByMonth tab, pull and notice that the $100 is gone. This is because the amount is NOT in the Reg Cutoff Bucket. Now, review dates will change throughout the budget season as Region/Corporate complete their reviews. For example, here Region has gone through a series of reviews and updated Reg Review Thru and Reg Cutoff to the values below. The save we completed at 10/1/2019 3:30 PM now falls into the Reg Cutoff Bucket. When this review date is updated, the amounts in Interject will be updated to move this amount automatically. We'll confirm using the same tools we did in previous steps. In the Budget Change Query Tool we see the $100 has moved to the Reg Cutoff column. Also notice that the $100 is still in the Corp Cutoff column, because Corp Cutoff shows ALL the amounts leading up to the Corp Cutoff date, which is 11/1/2019 5:00 PM in this case. With this in mind, check the Budget Book for both Reg Cutoff and Corp Cutoff versions. We should see the $100 in both, because it fits in the Reg Cutoff Bucket and happens before Corp Cutoff. To make sure, update the Versions on the Summary tab to Reg Review Thru and pull again. The $100 will be gone, because the save was after Reg Review Thru. AFTER CORP CUTOFF Now if an amount is saved AFTER the Corp Cutoff date, it will NOT be synced to Interject. Take the following example: we saved at 11/2/2019 5:00 PM (after the Corp Cutoff date used in earlier example). Let's check the two tools we used before to see how this shows up. Notice that the $5,000 is in the After Corp Cutoff column. It is also NOT included in the Change From Corp Cutoff column, because that includes only data BEFORE Corp Cutoff. In the Budget Book tool, we pull for the highest Versions setting, Corp Cutoff, to show EVERYTHING in Interject. Notice that the $5,000 is absent because it is not yet synced to Interject. Once the Corp Cutoff date is extended beyond 11/1/2019 5:00 PM, this amount will be synced to Interject. BOD and Versioning Once BOD is applied and versioning is enabled, the Review Dates no longer take effect. Budget amounts are not synced to Interject based on when they were saved but rather if their ChangeIDs are versioned by Corporate. Budget Cutoff Sync Dates The Control Center also controls when PI and Depr accounts get synced to Interject. When PI accounts are updated in the Contract Center, or Depr accounts in Capital, they will be synced through to Interject automatically as long as they are saved BEFORE their associated cutoff sync dates. If saved after, they will not be synced over. Once the cutoff sync dates are updated to a datetime after the updated account save, the unsynced changes will sync. Do I have rights to change the Cutoff Sync Dates? Only Corporate Admins have rights to update these dates. Drills There are many drills availabe on this tool, depending on where you drill from. Create New Projection Template opens a new Projection Template . Create New Budget Template opens a new Budget Template . Drilling on the Review Date columns gives the following drill options: Drill to Change History - Summary opens the Summary tab on the Budget Change Query Tool .

Validation definitions and assigned versions are like watermarks for each critical report. With Interject Financials for Epicor, reports are continually validated as they’re built, creating an automated “dev/test” process for each validated report, and locking it down when done, so your end process is repeatable. Interject’s report library holds all validated reports within the Financials for Epicor application, providing a central place to manage versions and serve reports. Flexibility With Interject’s configuration tool, you get control over governed and ungoverned report templates, so admins/implementers can build out or modify exactly the reports they need. Additional agility comes from Interject’s tying in your multiple data sources. Configurable roll-ups let you pull multiple source properties into one, for aggregated analysis in one report.

Doing so will make your reports cleaner, easier to read, and more manageable. Common Excel functionality provides a simple way to do so, with only a little help from Interject. In the following example, we'll use a prebuilt report template that we know contains a subtotaled section with zeros and a zero sum. The method and syntax used here can be applied to any other Excel reporting situations, as they leverage common Excel formulas and knowledge. Hiding Rows and Sections with Zero Values To Do Step 1: If you would like to use our example report, download it first here Step 2: Open the Excel file and log in to Interject, then notice the subtotal in row 119 reading zero. Now hit Ctrl+Shift+T or the \"Quick Tools\" icon in the Interject Ribbon and press enter to Unfreeze Panes. Step 3: Now, click the plus sign directly over column C to expand the collapsed columns, and add a column to the left of column B. Step 10: Expand the Report Formula section, and in cell K11, type \"Hide Zero Subtotals\". This will label the formula you'll write in the cell to the right. In cell L11 enter =ReportHideRowOrColumn(). Click fx to open the Function Wizard, and enter the following information: OnPullSaveOrBoth: Pull OnClearRunOrBoth: Both RowOrColumnRange: B65:B140 Disabled: Leave blank Step 11: In cell K10 type \"For Backward Compatibility\". In cell L10 enter =ReportCalc() and click fx to open the Function Wizard. Enter the following: OnPullSaveOrBoth: Pull OnClearRunOrBoth: Both SheetOrWorkbook: Sheet SheetName: FRXBS Note: This may not be the same in your template. Disabled: Leave blank Step 12: To collapse the zero-value sections, add a set of references to each section in the hidden column area. You'll write these references in the two rows directly above the subtotal row, as well as the one above it. Enter an = in cell B119, click into cell B121, and click enter to complete the reference. Do this also for the partailly collapsed rows in cell B120 and B122. Step 13: Repeat the above step for every section of the report, always in column B. In the example below, you would reference cells B79, B80, and B96 to the title cell B81. Step 14: Now, in cell B34 enter the formula =IF(AND(H34=0,I34-0,J34=0),\"Hide\",\"Show\") Step 15: Close up all the expanded sections, and pull the report again. Notice that the row and section which previously had a zero value is now hidden. Note that the section is not gone or deleted; rather, it is hidden from your view.

In this section, you will find the three core modules and the tools they offer to give better visibility and control over the resources under your jurisdiction. Capital Module The Capital Module is designed to handle Capital POs, and it provides tools for controllers to review Capital allocations across sites and available assets. The Capital Input Tool is the most prevalent report in this set. It is used to save new, and to update existing, Capital POs. Other tools available here are the Capital Change History Tool, which gives a historical view to all of the Capital Changes made, and the Capital Export Tool, which exports the POs from Capital into DMS, where they can be further managed. Budget Module This module is focused on giving controllers the tools and structure to save Budgets in a clean, efficient manner. The Local Budget Template is a report that sites can download and manage independantly, providing more control over how money is budgeted to accounts. Other notable tools in this module include the Budget Upload Tool, where controllers can dump budgeted accounts all together; the Budget Change Query Tool, which provides different views to how Budgets have changed over the budget season; and the Control Center, which controls who has access to save to Budgets and when the data will flow from the Budget Module into Interject. Projections Module The Projections Module gives controllers the tools needed to forecast the amounts they think will be need in upcoming months. The Local Projections Template is used to save initial projection forecasts, and it closely matches the Local Budget Template in design and function. Other Projections tools include the Projections Change Query Tool, which gives insight into how Projections have changed while open; and the Projections Upload Tool, which is identical to the Budget Upload Tool but used for Projections.

Retain Rows - Related Parameters (used in the pull) Retain Rows - Required. Drop-down filter includes Yes, No-Show Last Saved, No-Show Prior Bud. If Yes, the Input columns will not clear on the pull. Retain Comments - Required. Drop-down filter includes Yes and No. If Yes, pulling on the report will not clear comments not yet saved to the database. Insert at End - Required. Drop-down filter includes Yes and No. If Yes and Retain Rows is also Yes, then new accounts get added at the bottom of their grouping. Summary and Detail Accounts - Related Parameters Insert By Full Acct - Required. Used in the pull. Drop-down filter includes Yes and No. For No, new accounts are aggregated at the summary level and dropped in. Zero Out Missing Accts - Required. Used in the save. Drop-down filter includes Yes and No. For Yes, accounts missing from the template are zeroed out. For No, missing accounts will keep their amounts, and any Summary level accounts are offset to include the missing accounts automatically. Input Field Explanations Retain Rows and how it works With Retain Rows on Yes, any inputs in the Input columns will remain when the template is refreshed, or even if the report is cleared. If it is No, the Input columns will copy the Projections saved to either the current year month or the last month (depending on the alternative option). For an example with Retain Rows Yes, the screenshot below shows a formula used on the 36000-600-00 account. Clear the report, and afterwards notice that not only have all of the rows remained, but the formula is still there as well. Setting Retain Comments to Yes will keep any comments saved in the template, even if there are different comments saved in the database. If a new account is added to the Template with Retain Rows set to Yes, the setting for Insert at End dictates whether the account gets placed normally, in order, or gets inserted at the end. For example, if 36002-000-00 is added to the Template while Insert at End is set to No, the added account is placed between the 36000 and 36009 accounts. Otherwise, if Insert at End is set to Yes, the added account is at the bottom. Use this if you use formulas, so that newly added accounts do not interfere with them. Things to Remember After the first pull, Retain Rows will automatically be set to Yes, to preserve your file changes. Summary and Detail level accounts A new feature to the Projections Template is the ability to pull/save to Detail and Summary level accounts at the same time. Pulling Summary and Detail levels together On the pull, the Insert By Full Acct drop-down option dictates if the missing accounts are added on the Summary or Detail level. When Retain Rows is set to Yes, you can pull in accounts on a different level than the ones you already have in your template. In the screenshot below, we see five account combinations for the 36009 account. With Retain Rows set to Yes and Insert By Full Acct set to No, delete the 36009-000-00 and 36009-600-00 rows. Now when we pull, the two detail rows 36009-000-00 and 36009-600-00 are summarized into one row, with the account header of 36009 alone. 36009-000-00 had $1,000 amounts for all months, and 36009-600-00 had $2,000 for all months. Together they have $3,000 for all months. Things to Remember For this to work, Retain Rows MUST be set to Yes. Otherwise, if Retain Rows is set to No and you pull, ALL accounts will be pulled on the Detail Level. Saving Summary and Detail levels together When saving with Summary and Detail level accounts on the same template, the Summary level accounts are saved to the 000-00 version of the summarized account. Depending on the Zero Out Missing Accts setting, the Detail level accounts already in the database will either be zeroed out or remain unaltered. Using the example accounts from above, let's update the summarized account for 36009 to $3,500 for all months. First we save with Zero Out Missing Accts set to No, and pull in all detail rows by setting Retain Rows to No and Insert By Full Acct to Yes. The Projection saved to 36009-000-00 is the offset of $3,500 per month (summarized amount) and $2,000 per month for 36009-600-00 (amounts in database). This updated the $1,000 in the database 36009-000-00 to $1,500, so that the summarize amount matches what was saved AND preserves the amount already assigned to 36009-600-00. If we had set Zero Out Missing Accts to Yes instead, the pull on detail would have looked like example below. Now 36009-000-00 has the full $3,500 for each month, and 36009-600-00 has been zeroed out because it was not in the template. Things to Remember If you delete other accounts from the template, they will be zeroed out as well, if Zero Out Missing Accts is set to Yes (even if they do not have a summary level account present in the template). When saving with a Summary level account (only Acct is present), you cannot also save to the same account with 000-00 included. The save thinks the two accounts are the same, and they will be marked as duplicates. Dynamic Projection Columns Depending on the Projection fiscal period, the number of months you project to can change. For the majority of the fiscal period, it will be three months. For August you project out to five months, and for September it is four months. The template will update automatically based on the Year Month when you pull on the tool. Notice the screenshots below, which show the last saved data changing the columns dynamically (this applies to the other sections of the tool as well). The Autocalcs The majority of accounts in your template will be marked Manual Input in the Proj Method column (column J). Some of the other accounts will have something different in this column and are considered Autocalcs. There are many different types of Autocalcs, but it's important to know that you cannot edit them with the Projections Template. These accounts are managed by Corporate. Notice also that any Manual Input account is highlighted yellow, and the Autocalcs are grayed out. Autocalc Handling It is best practice to set your Autocalc input columns to equal the last saved columns from Interject. That way your your inputs will automatically update when assumptions are changed, and your EBITDA will tie out. Do I have security rights to Save from the Projections Template?

Each report template you publish will be versioned, so that you can track changes. You can also set the status of report templates to Dev, Test, Live, or Superseded. Once set to live, all users in your organization with access to the Report Library will see and can use the report template through their Report Library. In this example, we'll use a template created internally by Interject developers. However, the same process will be applied once you've finished making your own report template following the steps in other pages of this training section. To Do: Step 1: Hit Ctrl-Shift-J or the pull button, and click Clear Step 2: With the data cleared, save the Excel file on the local machine, either on the desktop or in a folder you've specified for this purpose. Step 3: Now open the Report Library, either using Ctrl-Shift-L or the Report Library button on the Interject Ribbon. If you need to create a new folder for your published report, you can right click in the Folders section and add a new subfolder. Otherwise, right click in the Report Links section and choose Create a New Link. Step 4: In the \"Create New Link\" window, type in \"Link Name\" the name you want for the report template in the library. You should also add a description at this point, especially if your report template is an updated version. Step 5: Set the version to Dev, Test, Live, or Superseded. We use live in this example. You can also give the template a version name and version notes to document what changed. Live: Standard users can only see live reports, so only use this when the report is ready to be published. Test: Test means that development is complete, but the report is still in testing. Dev: In development by the report writer. Superseded: A report that is no longer used but is still available to admin users for review. Step 6: Choose the link path by clicking Browse and locating the Excel file you just saved. Step 7: If you've created documentation for your report template, you can add a link to it here using either a web-link, a local or network file, a local folder, or a Windows process. Additionally, you can attach a local file path. Step 8: Click Save. Updating Existing Report Templates The process for updating existing report teplates is largely similar to saving entirely new templates. We'll begin with the BALCONSOL report open. To Do: Step 1: While still in the report template you just saved, click Save As, and give the file an updated version name, such as \"BALCONSOL_v2.6.3\". Step 2: Hit Ctrl-Shift-L or the Report Library button on the Interject Ribbon. Step 3: Right click on the version of the report you have updated, choose **Save Current Workbook\", and then choose \"Create New Version of \"[name of your report]\"\". Step 4: In the \"Create New Version\" window, you will complete the same information as the steps above for saving a new report. The difference is that you will want to include an updated Version Name\" and description to identify the updated report as separate from previous versions. Step 5: You will be prompted to convert any other Live versions of the report to Superseded. Click Yes. Your new report version will now be saved and available in the Report Library.

The default is \"Interject_Reporting\", but you can name it as needed Press OK Step 3: Point the script window to the new database Step 4: Execute the Initial.Interject_Reporting.sql script Step 5: Create security objects and grant read-only access to Epicor tables by passing the following parameters using the following script as an example: EXEC [Custom].[Interject_SetupScript1_Security] @MasterEpicorDatabase = '<Epicor Controlling Database Name>' ,@CertificatePassword = 'myPassword1234' 5a: MasterEpicorDatabase (specify master Epicor DB) 5b: CertificatePassword (create a certificate with a custom password) Technical Note: This will create [LocalDomain]/InterjectUser group and provide it with a new db_Interject role. This role will have execute rights to 3 schemas [Client], [Custom], and [Report]. This script also creates a certificate and signs store procedures that have dynamic code. The certificate provides read only access to the sign store procedures on the already-used tables of your Epicor databases. If at any point these store procedures are changed, the certificate will be invalidated and will need to be reapplied.

Option 1: Moving the Entire Database – This option should only be used when \"Live\" and \"Test\" environment are similar. The following criteria must be met: Epicor test database(s) need to be snapshots of \"Live\". (Data in \"Test\" server can be older than what is on \"Live\") Epicor data on \"Test\" was not changed since the snapshot from \"Live\" All Epicor database(s) on “Live” should also be in “Test” SQL Server version and setup of “Test” should match “Live” Option 2: Deploying A New Implementation from Scratch – This option will take more time, but it will be a from-scratch installation. The installation steps will mirror the initial deploy for a “Test” server. Additional steps will include transferring rollups, templates, and reports from “Test” company to “Live”. Option 1: Moving the Entire Database This option details the steps in restoring a backup of Interject_Reporting from a \"Test\" to a \"Live\" environment and connecting the database so it imports and reporting work. Before using this option review the requirement listed above. To Do Step 1: Create a backup of the \"Test\" database and restore it on the \"Live\" server. Step 2: To reapply security to the live DB, execute the Interject_SetupScript1_Security stored procedure, seen below. EXEC [Custom].[Interject_SetupScript1_Security] @MasterEpicorDatabase = '<Epicor Controlling Database Name>' ,@CertificatePassword = 'myPassword1234' Step 3: Execute ERP_InstallScript5_SetupJobs, as seen below, to create sync jobs --Setup SQL Agent Jobs to seed \"nightly\" sync of Interject data store EXEC [Custom].[ERP_InstallScript5_SetupJobs] Step 4: Go through the steps required for Interject Application Setup - Data Connection. Step 5: After following the Data Connection Setup, do an initial smoke test on all the stock reports, checking for drill, pull, and save functionality. Step 6: Contact Interject Support to request that your custom reports be migrated from \"Test\" company Report Library to your new \"Live\" company. Step 7: Review your Schedule to confirm Sync Jobs Option 2: Deploying A New Implementation From Scratch This option involves installing an entirely new instance of Interject, as well as completing a new Initial Data Load. Once those are complete, you will have to manually \"transfer\" your Custom Rollups and Custom Reports from \"Test\" to \"Live\" environments. Re-Deploy From Scratch These steps repeat the Initial Install and Initial Data Load covered in the Install menu. To Do Step 1: Complete all steps the Data Tier Install.
