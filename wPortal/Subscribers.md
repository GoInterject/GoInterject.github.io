If you click on a subscriber, you can edit details:

- **Expiration:** The subscriber will not have access to the app after this date
- **Revised Name:** The name that will appear in the Report Library for this app folder
- **Offering Revised Sort Order:** A number that will sort the Report Library Folder in relation to other folders
