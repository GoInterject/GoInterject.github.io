## Overview

The [Interject Portal](https://portal.gointerject.com/) site allows you to add, edit, or delete users from your organization via the Staff Page. Here you can also activate or deactivate a user. Viewing the Staff Page and all the functionally with it is only accomplished with the [ClientAdmin](/wPortal/INTERJECT-Roles.html#clientadmin-role) role.

### The Staff Page

The staff page includes a list of all users that have access to Interject within your company. On the left navigation pane, click **Staff**.
