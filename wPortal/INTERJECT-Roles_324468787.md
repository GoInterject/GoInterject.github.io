##  Overview 

At the bottom of the User Profile page are the roles you currently have assigned to your profile. There are a number of roles to choose from. Once changed, the user will need to log in again to the INTERJECT Excel Add-in for the changes to take effect. 

You can add roles by selecting the role name. Remove roles by clicking the small garbage icon for each role.
