##  Overview 
---
At the bottom of the User Profile page are the roles you currently have assigned to your profile. There are a number of roles to choose from. Once changed, the user will need to log in again to the INTERJECT Excel Add-in for the changes to take effect. 

You can add roles by selecting the role name. Remove roles by clicking the small garbage icon for each role. 

The table below summarizes each role and their purpose:
