At the bottom of the [User Profile](https://docs.gointerject.com/wPortal/User-Profile.html) page are the roles you currently have assigned to your profile. There are a number of roles to choose from. Roles can stack, meaning each role adds the associated permissions to the user.

You can add roles by selecting the role name from the drop down list. Then click **Add New Role** to add the role to the user's profile. Remove roles by clicking the small garbage <font size="+1">&#x1F5D1;</font> icon for each role.
